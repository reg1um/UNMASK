"For some moments after he had materialized, and had become perceivable by human senses, the Sylan waited.", 1
"This boy, as yet, was so unhappily engrossed in literary composition as not to have noticed his ghostly visitant.", 1
"Most demons were obsessed by the notion of buying from you a soul which Gerald, in this age of reason, had no sure proof that he possessed.", 3
"Candor is no more palatable than an oyster when either is out of season.", 1
"And my relatives are all cursed with a very disastrous candor.", 1
"They conceal from me nothing save that respect and envy with which they might, appropriately, regard my accomplishments and nobler qualities.", 3
"The first person, Gerald, that pretended to speak for the real good of anybody else was a serpent in a Garden, and ever since then that sort of talking has been venomous.", 1
"You allude, I imagine,” said the Sylan, “to the love of a good woman?", 3
"That is it, that is precisely the unmerited and too irremovable blessing which may end, after all, in reducing me to your suggested vulgar fraction of a suicide.", 1
"He meditatively placed together the tips of his two little fingers, and then one by one the tips of his other fingers, until his thumbs also were in contact.", 1
"And Evelyn, sir, in this matter of continuing her immoral relations with me has behaved badly, very badly indeed—", 3
"Repentance when suitably timed in a liaison makes for everybody’s happiness.", 3
"But some women, sir, some women stay more affectionately adhesive than an anaconda.", 1
"I also in my time have heard that observation without any active enjoyment.", 3
"It is, I believe, unanswerable.", 1
"Oh, I assure you, my dear fellow, there is no more sensible piece of friendly counsel existent than is the Seventh Commandment!", 1
"For I perceive you are now about to wheedle me forward in this business by throwing obstacles in my way.", 1
"Yes, to be sure! Women do vary in their given names.", 3
"I note that I falter in the little art of letters, that my prose is no longer superb and breath-taking in its loveliness, because my heart is not any longer really interested in writing.", 1
"And from whom else—just as you have suggested, my dear fellow,—from whom else save the Master Philologist can I get the great and best words of magic?", 1
"Yet the Master Philologist is nowadays a married man, and is ruled in everything by his wife.", 1
"Mirrors are employed in many branches of magic.", 3
"For one, I would not meddle with that mirror.", 1
"When a citizen of the United States of America takes up the pursuit of an art, sir, he does not shilly-shally about it.", 1
"Meanwhile, I admit, the life of a Sylan has no fret in it, a Sylan has nothing to be afraid of: and there is in me a mortal taint which cannot endure interminable contentment any longer.", 1
"But that, my dear fellow, would leave me without any carnal residence.", 1
"Why, Gerald, but I am surprised at such scepticism in you who pay your pew-rent so regularly!", 3
"So, let us get on!", 1
"I will take over all your body’s imbroglios, even with your mistress,—who can hardly be more tasking to get along with than are the seven official wives and the three hundred and fifty-odd concubines I am getting rid of.", 3
"You,” Gerald said, morosely, “do not know Evelyn Townsend.", 3
"I trust,” the Sylan stated, more gallantly, “to have that privilege to-morrow.", 3
"Instead, in Gerald Musgrave’s library, stood face to face two Geralds, each in a blue coat and a golden yellow waistcoat...", 1
"Oh, but, my poor Gerald, was he indeed!", 3
"My progenitor, in any event, carried through his imposture.", 1
"He died very well thought of by his neighbors.", 3
"That you will find to be a leading consideration with any citizen of the United States of America.", 1
"In American literature of a respectable cast no human being has any excretory functions.", 3

"The compulsion is upon me to excel in my art; and to do this I must liberate the great and best words of the Master Philologist.", 1
"To regard this Gerald Musgrave, now, was like looking at a droll acquaintance in whom Gerald was not, after all, very deeply interested.", 1
"The amenities of fellow artists,” returned Horvendile, “are by ordinary two-edged.", 1
"Meanwhile you have brought me this huge shining horse, which cannot be other than Pegasus—", 1
"Whether or not this divine steed be that Pegasus which bears romantics even to the ultimate goal of their dreams, depends upon the horseman.", 1
"Prophecies,” said Gerald, then, “ought to be respected by all well brought up persons.", 3
"Oh, but now I comprehend you! The rider and the owner of any horse is, quite naturally, entitled to call the animal whatsoever he prefers.", 3
"Yes, Horvendile, upon mature deliberation, I will accept the throne of Antan, without considering my personal preferences and my dislike of publicity and ostentation...", 3
"It would not be going too far to say, indeed, that she hungers for your coming.", 1
"This place has not any name in the reputable speech of men.", 1
"Very dreadful is the name of Koleos Koleros!", 1
"Such myths do not perish speedily.", 1
"All is a seeming and an echo: and through this superficies men come to know the untruth which makes them free.", 1
"She is wrinkled and flabby in appearance, yet the most stout of heroes falls at last before her.", 1
"Yet I have read, moreover, that this modest and retired Koleos Koleros, alone of eternal beings, is ever ardent to quench the ardor of her servitors...", 3
"I mean that their religion, which ranks pleasure above all else, permits no man to pass by unpleased.", 3
"To be refined in one’s taste is eminently praiseworthy.", 3
"The surprising and mysterious joys which blaze up among these flute-players are, thus, very violent and delicious.", 1
"Gerald said then that kindness to dumb animals was generally reckoned a most estimable trait in the United States of America.", 3
"She is easily known, by her violet hair and her sharp teeth.", 1
"But, really now, my dear fellow! I have no talent whatever for music.", 3
"These flute-players are very ingenious.", 3
"Nothing will be lacking to you at this feast if you attend it with proper religious exaltation; and you will discover abilities there which will surprise you.", 3
"Sir,” Gerald now replied, with appropriate dignity, “I am, as were my fathers before me, a member of the Protestant Episcopal church.", 1
"In Lichfield,” Horvendile retorted, “to adhere to the religion of your fathers is tactful... tactfulness ought to be every wise man’s religion.", 1
"Yes, she has charms which give my thoughts, as it were, a locally religious turn, and make the notion of joining her a rather beautiful idea.", 3
"At this distance she is a rather beautiful idea: nearer, she would be only another woman with her clothes off.", 1
"That resemblance makes for every sedentary virtue.", 3
"It was in this way that Gerald began his journey by putting an affront upon Koleos Koleros.", 1
"A good-morning to you, ma’am,” Gerald had begun.", 1
"For he had it now.", 1
"This woman was uncommonly like Evelyn Townsend.", 1
"Garden of my joys, and summit of sagacity,” the Princess remarked, “you are learned.", 3
"Oh, no, ma’am, it is merely that, as a student of magic, one picks up such bits of information.", 1
"I am the heir apparent to a throne, I cannot honestly declare myself any more than that...", 3
"Well, now, ma’am, to me this looks like just ordinary water.", 1
"My lord, and acme of my contentment, you will recall, for one matter, the love that was between us in this world’s infancy...", 3
"What I meant to say was that I really must request you to desist.", 1
"Ah, yes, that lovely sonnet!” the Princess remarked, with the uneasiness manifested by every normal woman when a man begins to talk about poetry.", 3
"What else is now come to trouble us?” said the wives of the Sylan when Gerald came.", 1
"Ladies, I am Fair-haired Hoo, the Helper and the Preserver, the Lord of the Third Truth, the Well-beloved of Heavenly Ones.", 1
"Your meaning, sir,” said one of them, “may be terrible, but certainly it is not plain.", 1
"And do you doubt my divine word?", 1
"We thus know nothing of its customs.", 1
"To the aged, such as I have now become, the Mirror of Caer Omn reveals nothing any more...", 1
"I regard a mirror which begets any such young fellows as a rather beautiful idea.", 3
"But what under the sun has the sun,” said Gerald, a little flustered, “to do with the not inconsiderable favor which I have conferred upon this country?", 1
"For of course, just as you say, it does seem fairly obvious I am a sun god.", 3
"Thereafter Fair-haired Hoo, the Helper and Preserver, the Lord of the Third Truth, when he had announced his various titles... moistened his finger-tip...", 1
"It was Heaven he was defying, he who was an apostate god, a god unfrightened by the animosity of his divine fellows.", 1
"And his was a splendid martyrdom, for the winged daughters of old Ocean fluttered everywhere about him in the golden Scythian air, like wailing seagulls...", 1
"He turned from these transient things to drunkenness and to the embraces of women, he hunted forgetfulness upon the breasts of nine hundred women...", 1
"He aided in the pillaging of it: the golden armor of Achilles fell to his share.", 1
"There was no one anywhere more quick in wiles than was Odysseus, Laertes’ son.", 1
"But in his hand was still the rope with which he had led this ram, and in his other hand was a bag containing silver money...", 1
"It was a supreme infamy, it was man’s masterpiece in the way of iniquity, it was the reply of a very fine poet to Heaven’s proffered truce...", 1
"But when she returned to him, incredibly beautiful, and pale and proud, and quite naked... then the divine Augusta drew him implacably downward among the dead...", 1
"Yet a gibbet stood uncomfortably near to the place: upon bright days the shadow of this gallows fell across the threshold of the room in which they rather squalidly made merry.", 1
"Time was preparing by and by (still at the instigation of ruthless Heaven) to make an end even to François Villon, who was still so fine a poet...", 1
"But when he would have touched the Swan’s daughter, the delight of gods and men, she vanished, precisely as a touched bubble is shattered into innumerable sparkling bits...", 1
"It would be quite entertaining to enter into Merlin’s dark heart.", 1
"And I who willed to be Lord of the Third Truth have found no third truth anywhere.", 1
"I have found only comfortably colored illusions.", 1
"But I am content with that which I have found here upon Mispec Moor.", 1
"And after that, also, the date of his departure from her neat cottage was postponed until after Sunday...", 1
"His divine steed was for the while turned out to graze with those docile geldings that had once been knights and barons and reigning kings...", 1
"It seemed a bit droll thus to be confronted with so much strange work performed by his own natural body...", 1
"For here were not any folderol romances such as Gerald himself, he felt uneasily, might have perhaps contrived...", 1
"My body in my absence has become, thanks to my body’s books, a reputable and even a looked-up-to citizen.", 3
"Next Gerald lighted on a black box with silver corners, and inside it was a time-discolored manuscript.", 1
"There was not in my natural body sufficient power to sustain the high inspiration of my youth.", 1
"That is a strange and glorious word for you to be telling me,” the boy began.", 1
"I have bought feet too old for errancy, ears that are deaf to the high gods... and I have bought eyes too dim to note whether or not Antan still gleams on the horizon.", 3
"Has my body, during your inhabitancy of it, my dear fellow, escaped from Evelyn Townsend?", 1
"Your body and the body of your Cousin Evelyn have always been such good friends!", 3
"It has been generally felt,” the youngster answered, “that a prominent man of letters was entitled to his Egeria.", 3
"So I stay faithful to one woman, after all!", 3
"I am, in brief, in all respects, a credit to my native Lichfield, and, more generally, to the United States of America.", 3
"Well, certainly I must not spoil the miracle.", 3
"The sun rises in the east.", 1
"Well, that was an interesting choice.", 3

"But once more Kai Bok-su stayed behind.", 3
"It was a desperate undertaking, for French soldiers were now scattered through the country...", 3

"But everywhere the heathen were in great glee.", 3
"Christianity had been destroyed with the chapels, they were sure.", 3
"The triumphant shout that the mission had been wiped out ceased completely, and the people declared that they had been fools to try to destroy the chapels...", 3
"He seemed to forget all about what had been done and was 'up and at it again.'", 3
"For Oxford College was such a place of inspiration under Kai Bok-su, that even the servants in the kitchen wanted to go out and preach the gospel.", 3
"The best he could get was a small craft quite open, only twelve feet long.", 1
"It was not a very fine vessel with which to brave the Pacific Ocean, but where was the crazy craft in which Kai Bok-su would not embark to go and tell the gospel to the heathen?", 3
"He had seen the phosphorescent lights often before, but never anything like this.", 1
"And then with a common impulse, the rowers swung round and pulled straight out to sea...", 3
"This was far better than he had expected.", 3
"The cook-missionary had evidently spread wonderful reports of Kai Bok-su and his gospel and so prepared the way.", 1
"And now he was really here!", 3

"“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”", 1
"She has two nieces of her own.", 1
"She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.”", 1
"Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.", 1

"“To-morrow fortnight.”", 1
"“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.", 1
"I cannot quite agree with you there.", 3
"What say you, Mary?", 1
"For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books, and make extracts.”", 3
"Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.", 1
"“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr. Bingley.”", 3
"“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.", 1
"“I am sorry to hear that; but why did you not tell me so before?", 3
"It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”", 3
"Well, how pleased I am!", 1
"And it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now.”", 1
"“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.", 3
"At our time of life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes we would do anything.", 3
"The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.", 1
"Her report was highly favourable.", 1
"Sir William had been delighted with him.", 1
"He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.", 1
"Nothing could be more delightful!", 1
"To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.", 1
"In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.", 1
"An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.", 1
"Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted.", 1
"The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin.", 1
"Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.", 1
"His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.", 1
"His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien...", 1
"His character was decided.", 1
"He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.", 1
"Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.", 1
"You had much better dance.”", 1
"“I certainly shall not.", 1
"At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.", 1
"Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.”", 3
"“Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!", 1
"Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”", 1
"Mr. Bingley followed his advice.", 1
"Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.", 1
"She told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.", 1
"The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.", 1
"Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.", 1
"Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.", 1
"Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure.", 1
"With a book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.", 1
"He had rather hoped that all his wife’s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.", 3
"Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.", 1
"Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice.", 1
"O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”", 3
"I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.", 1
"Here she was interrupted again.", 1
"Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery.", 1
"So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring him!", 1
"He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!", 1
"Not handsome enough to dance with!", 1
"I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs.", 3
"I quite detest the man.”", 1
"When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.", 1
"“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!”", 1
"His character is thereby complete.”", 3
"“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.", 1
"I did not expect such a compliment.”", 1
"Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never.", 1
"What could be more natural than his asking you again?", 1
"Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.", 3
"You have liked many a stupider person.”", 3
"“Dear Lizzy!”", 1
"You never see a fault in anybody.", 1
"All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes.", 3
"I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”", 3
"“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think.”", 1
"Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it everywhere.", 1
"Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her.”", 1
"Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general...", 1
"They were, in fact, very fine ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.", 1
"Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character.", 1
"In understanding, Darcy was the superior.", 1
"Bingley was by no means deficient; but Darcy was clever.", 1
"He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.", 1
"In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.", 1
"Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually giving offence.", 1
"Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure.", 1
"Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too much.", 3
"Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate.", 1
"Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.", 1
"The distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly.", 3
"It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town...", 1
"Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.", 3
"The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s intimate friend.", 1
"That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.", 1
"“You began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civil self-command, to Miss Lucas.", 3
"“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”", 3
"“My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza,” said Charlotte.", 1
"Poor Eliza! to be only just tolerable.”", 3
"Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”", 1
"“Are you quite sure, ma’am? Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.", 1
"“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”", 1
"With them he is remarkably agreeable.”", 1
"“I do not believe a word of it, my dear.", 3
"If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.", 3
"“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I wish he had danced with Eliza.”", 1
"“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with him, if I were you.”", 1
"“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you never to dance with him.”", 3
"If I may so express it, he has a right to be proud.”", 1
"“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.”", 3
"Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously.", 1
"A person may be proud without being vain.", 1
"Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”", 1
"“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was.", 1
"I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”", 1
"The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would; and the argument ended only with the visit.", 1
"The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.", 1
"The visit was returned in due form.", 1
"By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them...", 1
"She mentioned this to her friend, Miss Lucas.", 1
"If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.", 1
"We can all begin freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.", 1
"In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show more affection than she feels.", 1
"Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”", 1
"“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.", 1
"If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too.”", 3
"“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”", 1
"Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention.", 1
"When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.”", 1
"“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.", 1
"But these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design.", 1
"She has known him only a fortnight.", 1
"This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.”", 1
"Had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal.”", 1
"Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.", 1
"They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”", 3
"“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.", 3
"You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”", 3
"Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.", 1
"He began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.", 1
"His doing so drew her notice.", 1
"It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were assembled.", 1
"“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”", 3
"He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”", 1
"“With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic.”", 3
"“You are severe on us.”", 3
"“It will be her turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas.", 3
"Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.", 1
"Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.", 1
"Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation...", 1
"I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies.”", 1
"“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”", 3
"Sir William only smiled.", 1
"“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”", 1
"“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.", 1
"Do you often dance at St. James’s?”", 1
"“Never, sir.”", 1
"“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”", 1
"“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”", 3
"“You have a house in town, I conclude?”", 1
"Mr. Darcy bowed.", 1
"He paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to make any...", 1
"Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.", 1
"You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”", 3
"“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.", 1
"I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”", 1
"Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain.", 1
"Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.", 1
"“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.", 3
"Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.", 1
"Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--", 1
"“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”", 3
"“I should imagine not.”", 3
"What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”", 3
"“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.", 1
"My mind was more agreeably engaged.", 1
"I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”", 1
"Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.", 1
"“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”", 1
"“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley.", 1
"“I am all astonishment.", 1
"How long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you joy?”", 3
"A lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment.", 3
"I knew you would be wishing me joy.”", 3
"“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled.", 3
"You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”", 3
"He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed along.", 1
"Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation...", 1
"Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.", 1
"She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.", 1
"The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week...", 1
"Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.", 1
"Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers’ names and connections.", 1
"Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.", 1
"Mr. Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before.", 1
"They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.", 1
"“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country.", 3
"I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced.”", 3
"Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter...", 1
"“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so ready to think your own children silly.", 3
"If I wished to think slightingly of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”", 3
"“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”", 3
"“Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”", 3
"“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.", 3
"Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.", 1
"Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--", 1
"“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say?", 1
"Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”", 1
"“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.", 1
"My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.", 1
"Yours ever, “CAROLINE BINGLEY.”", 1
"“With the officers!” cried Lydia: “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that.”", 1
"“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”", 3
"“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.", 1
"“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.”", 3
"“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home.”", 3
"“I had much rather go in the coach.”", 1
"“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”", 3
"“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose will be answered.”", 3
"She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day.", 3
"Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.", 1
"Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.", 1
"The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.", 1
"“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.", 3
"Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:--", 1
"My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better.", 1
"“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she should die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”", 3
"“Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying.", 1
"People do not die of little trifling colds.", 1
"She will be taken good care of.", 1
"As long as she stays there, it is all very well.", 3
"I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.”", 1
"Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative.", 1
"She declared her resolution.", 1
"“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt!", 3
"You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.”", 3
"“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”", 3
"“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the horses?”", 3
"The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.", 1
"I shall be back by dinner.”", 1
"“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”", 1
"“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.", 1
"Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.", 1
"“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”", 1
"In Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone...", 1
"She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.", 1
"She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was good-humour and kindness.", 1
"Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all.", 1
"The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.", 1
"Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.", 1
"Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room.", 1
"Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.", 1
"She was not equal, however, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with.", 1
"Elizabeth silently attended her.", 1
"When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane.", 1
"The apothecary came; and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.", 1
"The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.", 1
"Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.", 1
"When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so.", 1
"Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.", 1
"Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was despatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.", 1
"At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.", 1
"Jane was by no means better.", 1
"His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.", 1
"She had very little notice from any but him.", 1
"Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards...", 1
"When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.", 1
"Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence: she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.", 1
"Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added,--“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker.", 1
"I shall never forget her appearance this morning.", 1
"She really looked almost wild.”", 1
"“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance.", 3
"Very nonsensical to come at all!", 3
"Why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?", 3
"Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”", 1
"“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office.”", 1
"“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was all lost upon me.", 1
"I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning.", 1
"Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.”", 3
"“You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition.”", 3
"“Certainly not.”", 1
"It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.”", 1
"“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said Bingley.", 1
"“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper, “that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.”", 3
"“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.”", 1
"A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--", 1
"“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet girl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.", 1
"But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.”", 1
"“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton?”", 1
"“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”", 1
"“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.", 3
"“If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it would not make them one jot less agreeable.”", 3
"“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.", 1
"To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend’s vulgar relations.", 3
"With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.", 1
"She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep...", 1
"On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high, she declined it...", 1
"Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.", 1
"“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”", 3
"“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards.", 3
"She is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”", 3
"“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”", 1
"“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”", 1
"Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying.", 1
"He immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded.", 1
"Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.", 1
"“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left so small a collection of books.", 1
"What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”", 1
"“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many generations.”", 1
"“And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying books.”", 1
"“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.”", 3
"“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place.", 3
"Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.”", 1
"“I wish it may.”", 1
"“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”", 3
"“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”", 3
"“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”", 3
"Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table...", 1
"“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will she be as tall as I am?”", 1
"“I think she will.", 1
"She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or rather taller.”", 1
"Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”", 1
"“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.”", 3
"“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”", 3
"“Yes, all of them, I think.", 1
"They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses.", 1
"I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.”", 3
"The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.", 1
"I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished.”", 1
"“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.", 1
"“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.”", 1
"“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”", 1
"A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved.”", 1
"“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.”", 1
"“I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women.", 3
"I rather wonder now at your knowing any.”", 3
"“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?”", 3
"“I never saw such a woman.", 1
"Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order...", 1
"As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.", 1
"“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”", 1
"Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.”", 1
"Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.", 1
"Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.", 1
"Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.", 1
"This she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better.", 1
"Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.", 3
"They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.", 3
"Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid...", 1
"In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation.", 1
"The note was immediately despatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.", 1
"Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.", 1
"Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.", 3
"She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable.", 1
"Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.", 1
"“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer.", 1
"She is a great deal too ill to be moved.", 1
"Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.", 1
"We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.”", 3
"“Removed!” cried Bingley.", 1
"It must not be thought of.", 1
"My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.”", 3
"“You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, “that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us.”", 3
"Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.", 1
"You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.", 1
"I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.", 1
"You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.”", 3
"“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes.", 1
"At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”", 1
"“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.", 3
"“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.", 1
"“Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”", 3
"“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through, I am afraid, is pitiful.”", 3
"“That is as it happens.", 1
"It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”", 3
"“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”", 1
"“Yes; but intricate characters are the most amusing.", 3
"They have at least that advantage.”", 3
"“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for such a study.", 1
"In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.”", 1
"“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.”", 1
"“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.", 1
"I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town.”", 3
"Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.", 1
"Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph,--", 3
"“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except the shops and public places.", 1
"The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”", 1
"“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town, it is pretty much the same.", 1
"They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”", 1
"“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition.", 1
"But that gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing at all.”", 3
"“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother.", 1
"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.", 1
"He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.”", 1
"“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.", 1
"I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”", 1
"Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance.", 1
"His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile.", 1
"Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away.", 1
"“Yes, she called yesterday with her father.", 1
"What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he?", 1
"He has always something to say to everybody.", 1
"That is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”", 3
"“Did Charlotte dine with you?”", 1
"“No, she would go home.", 1
"I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies.", 3
"For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up differently.", 3
"But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you.", 1
"It is a pity they are not handsome!", 3
"Not that I think Charlotte so very plain; but then she is our particular friend.”", 3
"“She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.", 1
"“Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain.", 1
"Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty.", 1
"I do not like to boast of my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody better looking.", 3
"It is what everybody says.", 1
"I do not trust my own partiality.", 3
"But, however, he did not.", 1
"Perhaps he thought her too young.", 1
"However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”", 1
"“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently.", 3
"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.", 1
"I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”", 3
"“I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love,” said Darcy.", 1
"“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.", 1
"Everything nourishes what is strong already.", 1
"But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”", 3
"Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.", 1
"She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.", 1
"Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.", 1
"She performed her part, indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.", 1
"I didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.", 3
"I don’t play accurately—any one can play accurately—but I play with wonderful expression.", 3
"As far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte.", 1
"And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?", 1
"Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.", 1
"Why is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne?", 3
"I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir.", 3
"I have often observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a first-rate brand.", 1
"Is marriage so demoralising as that?", 3
"I believe it is a very pleasant state, sir.", 3
"I have had very little experience of it myself up to the present.", 1
"That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and a young person.", 3
"I don’t know that I am much interested in your family life, Lane.", 3
"No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject.", 1
"Lane’s views on marriage seem somewhat lax.", 1
"Really, if the lower orders don’t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them?", 3
"They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.", 3
"How are you, my dear Ernest?", 1
"What brings you up to town?", 1
"Oh, pleasure, pleasure! What else should bring one anywhere?", 3
"I believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five o’clock.", 3
"Where have you been since last Thursday?", 1
"When one is in town one amuses oneself.", 1
"When one is in the country one amuses other people.", 3
"It is excessively boring.", 1
"Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?", 1
"Perfectly horrid! Never speak to one of them.", 1
"How immensely you must amuse them!", 3
"By the way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?", 1
"Hallo! Why all these cups?", 1
"Why cucumber sandwiches?", 1
"Why such reckless extravagance in one so young?", 3
"Who is coming to tea?", 1
"Oh! merely Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen.", 1
"How perfectly delightful!", 3
"Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won’t quite approve of your being here.", 1
"May I ask why?", 1
"My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly disgraceful.", 1
"It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.", 1
"I am in love with Gwendolen.", 1
"I have come up to town expressly to propose to her.", 1
"I thought you had come up for pleasure?", 3
"I call that business.", 3
"How utterly unromantic you are!", 1
"I really don’t see anything romantic in proposing.", 1
"It is very romantic to be in love.", 1
"But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal.", 1
"Why, one may be accepted.", 1
"One usually is, I believe.", 1
"Then the excitement is all over.", 1
"The very essence of romance is uncertainty.", 1
"If ever I get married, I’ll certainly try to forget the fact.", 3
"The Divorce Court was specially invented for people whose memories are so curiously constituted.", 3
"Divorces are made in Heaven—", 3
"Please don’t touch the cucumber sandwiches.", 1
"They are ordered specially for Aunt Augusta.", 1
"Well, you have been eating them all the time.", 1
"That is quite a different matter.", 3
"She is my aunt.", 1
"Have some bread and butter.", 1
"The bread and butter is for Gwendolen.", 1
"Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.", 1
"And very good bread and butter it is too.", 1
"Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it all.", 3
"You behave as if you were married to her already.", 3
"You are not married to her already, and I don’t think you ever will be.", 1
"Why on earth do you say that?", 1
"Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with.", 1
"Girls don’t think it right.", 1
"Oh, that is nonsense!", 1
"It accounts for the extraordinary number of bachelors that one sees all over the place.", 1
"In the second place, I don’t give my consent.", 1
"Your consent!", 1
"My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin.", 1
"And before I allow you to marry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily.", 1
"Cecily! What on earth do you mean?", 1
"What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily!", 1
"I don’t know any one of the name of Cecily.", 1
"Bring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-room the last time he dined here.", 1
"Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?", 1
"I wish to goodness you had let me know.", 1
"I have been writing frantic letters to Scotland Yard about it.", 1
"I was very nearly offering a large reward.", 1
"Well, I wish you would offer one.", 3
"I happen to be more than usually hard up.", 1
"There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.", 3
"However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the inscription inside, I find that the thing isn’t yours after all.", 3
"Of course it’s mine.", 1
"You have seen me with it a hundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written inside.", 1
"It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case.", 1
"More than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldn’t read.", 3
"I simply want my cigarette case back.", 1
"Yes; but this isn’t your cigarette case.", 1
"This cigarette case is a present from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn’t know any one of that name.", 1
"Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.", 1
"Your aunt!", 1
"Charming old lady she is, too.", 3
"Lives at Tunbridge Wells.", 1
"Just give it back to me, Algy.", 1
"But why does she call herself little Cecily if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells?", 1
"My dear fellow, what on earth is there in that?", 3
"Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall.", 1
"That is a matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself.", 3
"You seem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt!", 3
"That is absurd!", 1
"For Heaven’s sake give me back my cigarette case.", 1
"Yes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle?", 1
"Besides, your name isn’t Jack at all; it is Ernest.", 1
"It isn’t Ernest; it’s Jack.", 1
"You have always told me it was Ernest.", 1
"I have introduced you to every one as Ernest.", 1
"You answer to the name of Ernest.", 1
"You look as if your name was Ernest.", 3
"You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in my life.", 3
"It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn’t Ernest.", 1
"It’s on your cards.", 1
"Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the cigarette case was given to me in the country.", 1
"Come, old boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.", 1
"My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist.", 3
"It is very vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn’t a dentist.", 3
"It produces a false impression.", 1
"Well, that is exactly what dentists always do.", 3
"Now, go on! Tell me the whole thing.", 1
"I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a confirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it now.", 1
"Bunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?", 1
"I’ll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon as you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town and Jack in the country.", 1
"Well, produce my cigarette case first.", 1
"Now produce your explanation, and pray make it improbable.", 3
"My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at all.", 1
"In fact it’s perfectly ordinary.", 1
"Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who adopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his grand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew.", 1
"Where is that place in the country, by the way?", 1
"You are not going to be invited . . .", 1
"I may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.", 1
"I suspected that, my dear fellow!", 1
"I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire on two separate occasions.", 3
"Why are you Ernest in town and Jack in the country?", 1
"My dear Algy, I don’t know whether you will be able to understand my real motives.", 1
"You are hardly serious enough.", 3
"When one is placed in the position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects.", 1
"It’s one’s duty to do so.", 1
"That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and simple.", 3
"The truth is rarely pure and never simple.", 3
"Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!", 3
"That wouldn’t be at all a bad thing.", 3
"Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow.", 1
"You should leave that to people who haven’t been at a University.", 3
"They do it so well in the daily papers.", 3
"What you really are is a Bunburyist.", 1
"I was quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist.", 1
"You are one of the most advanced Bunburyists I know.", 3
"What on earth do you mean?", 1
"You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like.", 1
"I have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose.", 1
"Bunbury is perfectly invaluable.", 1
"I haven’t asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.", 1
"You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations.", 3
"It is very foolish of you.", 1
"Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving invitations.", 3
"You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.", 1
"I haven’t the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind.", 1
"To begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to dine with one’s own relations.", 3
"She will place me next Mary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the dinner-table.", 1
"That is not very pleasant.", 1
"Indeed, it is not even decent . . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase.", 1
"The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous.", 3
"It looks so bad.", 1
"It is simply washing one’s clean linen in public.", 3
"Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying.", 1
"I want to tell you the rules.", 1
"I’m not a Bunburyist at all.", 1
"If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to kill my brother, indeed I think I’ll kill him in any case.", 1
"Cecily is a little too much interested in him.", 1
"It is rather a bore.", 1
"So I am going to get rid of Ernest.", 1
"Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get married, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad to know Bunbury.", 3
"A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very tedious time of it.", 3
"That is nonsense.", 1
"If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is the only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly won’t want to know Bunbury.", 1
"Then your wife will.", 3
"You don’t seem to realise, that in married life three is company and two is none.", 3
"That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.", 3
"Yes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.", 3
"For heaven’s sake, don’t try to be cynical.", 1
"It’s perfectly easy to be cynical.", 3
"My dear fellow, it isn’t easy to be anything nowadays.", 3
"There’s such a lot of beastly competition about.", 1
"Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta.", 1
"Only relatives, or creditors, ever ring in that Wagnerian manner.", 3
"Yes, but you must be serious about it.", 1
"I hate people who are not serious about meals.", 3
"It is so shallow of them.", 3
"Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well.", 3
"I’m feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.", 1
"That’s not quite the same thing.", 3
"In fact the two things rarely go together.", 3
"Dear me, you are smart!", 1
"I am always smart!", 1
"Am I not, Mr. Worthing?", 1
"You’re quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.", 1
"Oh! I hope I am not that.", 3
"It would leave no room for developments, and I intend to develop in many directions.", 3
"I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years younger.", 3
"And now I’ll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber sandwiches you promised me.", 1
"Certainly, Aunt Augusta.", 1
"Won’t you come and sit here, Gwendolen?", 1
"Thanks, mamma, I’m quite comfortable where I am.", 3
"Good heavens! Lane! Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?", 1
"I ordered them specially.", 1
"There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir.", 1
"I went down twice.", 1
"No cucumbers!", 1
"Not even for ready money.", 1
"That will do, Lane, thank you.", 1
"Thank you, sir.", 1
"I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no cucumbers, not even for ready money.", 3
"It really makes no matter, Algernon.", 1
"I had some crumpets with Lady Harbury, who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.", 3
"I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.", 3
"It certainly has changed its colour.", 1
"From what cause I, of course, cannot say.", 3
"I’ve quite a treat for you to-night, Algernon.", 1
"I am going to send you down with Mary Farquhar.", 1
"She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband.", 3
"It’s delightful to watch them.", 3
"I am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the pleasure of dining with you to-night after all.", 1
"I hope not, Algernon.", 1
"It would put my table completely out.", 1
"Your uncle would have to dine upstairs.", 1
"Fortunately he is accustomed to that.", 3
"It is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment to me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again.", 3
"They seem to think I should be with him.", 3
"It is very strange.", 1
"This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad health.", 3
"Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.", 3
"Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die.", 3
"This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd.", 1
"Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids.", 1
"I consider it morbid.", 1
"Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.", 3
"Health is the primary duty of life.", 1
"I am always telling that to your poor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as any improvement in his ailment goes.", 1
"I’ll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious, and I think I can promise you he’ll be all right by Saturday.", 3
"Of course the music is a great difficulty.", 1
"You see, if one plays good music, people don’t listen, and if one plays bad music people don’t talk.", 3
"But I’ll run over the programme I’ve drawn out, if you will kindly come into the next room for a moment.", 1
"Thank you, Algernon.", 1
"It is very thoughtful of you.", 1
"I’m sure the programme will be delightful, after a few expurgations.", 3
"French songs I cannot possibly allow.", 1
"People always seem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh, which is worse.", 1
"But German sounds a thoroughly respectable language, and indeed, I believe is so.", 3
"Gwendolen, you will accompany me.", 1
"Certainly, mamma.", 1
"Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.", 1
"Pray don’t talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing.", 1
"Whenever people talk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that they mean something else.", 3
"And that makes me so nervous.", 1
"I do mean something else.", 1
"I thought so.", 1
"In fact, I am never wrong.", 3
"Mamma has a way of coming back suddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her about.", 1
"Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you more than any girl . . . I have ever met since . . . I met you.", 1
"Yes, I am quite well aware of the fact.", 1
"And I often wish that in public, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative.", 3
"For me you have always had an irresistible fascination.", 1
"Even before I met you I was far from indifferent to you.", 3
"We live, as I hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals.", 1
"There is something in that name that inspires absolute confidence.", 1
"The moment Algernon first mentioned to me that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love you.", 1
"You really love me, Gwendolen?", 1
"Passionately!", 1
"Darling! You don’t know how happy you’ve made me.", 1
"My own Ernest!", 1
"But you don’t really mean to say that you couldn’t love me if my name wasn’t Ernest?", 1
"But your name is Ernest.", 1
"Yes, I know it is.", 1
"But supposing it was something else?", 1
"Do you mean to say you couldn’t love me then?", 1
"It suits you perfectly.", 1
"It is a divine name.", 1
"It has a music of its own.", 1
"It produces vibrations.", 1
"Well, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of other much nicer names.", 1
"I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.", 1
"It does not thrill.", 1
"It produces absolutely no vibrations . . .", 1
"I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were more than usually plain.", 3
"Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for John!", 1
"And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John.", 3
"She would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a single moment’s solitude.", 3
"The only really safe name is Ernest.", 1
"Gwendolen, I must get christened at once—I mean we must get married at once.", 1
"There is no time to be lost.", 1
"Married, Mr. Worthing?", 1
"You know that I love you, and you led me to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent to me.", 1
"I adore you.", 1
"But you haven’t proposed to me yet.", 1
"Nothing has been said at all about marriage.", 1
"The subject has not even been touched on.", 1
"Well . . . may I propose to you now?", 1
"I think it would be an admirable opportunity.", 1
"And to spare you any possible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you quite frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to accept you.", 3
"Gwendolen!", 1
"Yes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?", 1
"You know what I have got to say to you.", 1
"Yes, but you don’t say it.", 1
"Gwendolen, will you marry me?", 1
"Of course I will, darling.", 1
"How long you have been about it!", 1
"I am afraid you have had very little experience in how to propose.", 3
"My own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.", 1
"Yes, but men often propose for practice.", 1
"I know my brother Gerald does.", 1
"All my girl-friends tell me so.", 1
"What wonderfully blue eyes you have, Ernest!", 1
"They are quite, quite, blue.", 1
"I hope you will always look at me just like that, especially when there are other people present.", 3
"Mr. Worthing! Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture.", 1
"It is most indecorous.", 1
"Mamma! I must beg you to retire.", 1
"This is no place for you.", 3
"Besides, Mr. Worthing has not quite finished yet.", 3
"Finished what, may I ask?", 1
"I am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma.", 1
"Pardon me, you are not engaged to any one.", 1
"When you do become engaged to some one, I, or your father, should his health permit him, will inform you of the fact.", 3
"An engagement should come on a young girl as a surprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be.", 3
"It is hardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself . . .", 3
"And now I have a few questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing.", 1
"While I am making these inquiries, you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the carriage.", 1
"In the carriage, Gwendolen!", 1
"Gwendolen, the carriage!", 1
"Yes, mamma.", 1
"You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.", 1
"Thank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.", 1
"I feel bound to tell you that you are not down on my list of eligible young men, although I have the same list as the dear Duchess of Bolton has.", 1
"We work together, in fact.", 1
"However, I am quite ready to enter your name, should your answers be what a really affectionate mother requires.", 3
"Do you smoke?", 1
"Well, yes, I must admit I smoke.", 1
"I am glad to hear it.", 3
"A man should always have an occupation of some kind.", 3
"There are far too many idle men in London as it is.", 1
"How old are you?", 1
"Twenty-nine.", 1
"A very good age to be married at.", 1
"I have always been of opinion that a man who desires to get married should know either everything or nothing.", 3
"Which do you know?", 1
"I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.", 3
"I am pleased to hear it.", 3
"I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance.", 3
"Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.", 3
"The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound.", 1
"Fortunately in England, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever.", 3
"What is your income?", 1
"Between seven and eight thousand a year.", 1
"In land, or in investments?", 1
"In investments, chiefly.", 1
"That is satisfactory.", 1
"I didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.", 3
"I don’t play accurately—any one can play accurately—but I play with wonderful expression.", 3
"As far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte.", 1
"I keep science for Life.", 3
"Yes, sir.", 1
"And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?", 1
"Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.", 1
"Why is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne?", 3
"I ask merely for information.", 3
"I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir.", 3
"I have often observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a first-rate brand.", 3
"Good heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?", 3
"I believe it is a very pleasant state, sir.", 3
"I have had very little experience of it myself up to the present.", 1
"I have only been married once.", 1
"That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and a young person.", 3
"I don’t know that I am much interested in your family life, Lane.", 3
"No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject.", 1
"I never think of it myself.", 3
"Very natural, I am sure.", 3
"That will do, Lane, thank you.", 1
"Thank you, sir.", 1
"Lane’s views on marriage seem somewhat lax.", 1
"Really, if the lower orders don’t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them?", 3
"They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.", 3
"How are you, my dear Ernest?", 1
"What brings you up to town?", 1
"Oh, pleasure, pleasure! What else should bring one anywhere?", 3
"Eating as usual, I see, Algy!", 1
"I believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five o’clock.", 3
"Where have you been since last Thursday?", 1
"When one is in town one amuses oneself.", 1
"When one is in the country one amuses other people.", 3
"It is excessively boring.", 1
"And who are the people you amuse?", 1
"Oh, neighbours, neighbours.", 3
"Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?", 1
"Perfectly horrid! Never speak to one of them.", 1
"How immensely you must amuse them!", 3
"By the way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?", 1
"Hallo! Why all these cups?", 1
"Why cucumber sandwiches?", 1
"Why such reckless extravagance in one so young?", 3
"Who is coming to tea?", 1
"Oh! merely Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen.", 1
"How perfectly delightful!", 3
"Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won’t quite approve of your being here.", 1
"May I ask why?", 1
"My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly disgraceful.", 1
"It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.", 1
"I am in love with Gwendolen.", 1
"I have come up to town expressly to propose to her.", 1
"I thought you had come up for pleasure?", 3
"I call that business.", 3
"How utterly unromantic you are!", 1
"I really don’t see anything romantic in proposing.", 1
"It is very romantic to be in love.", 1
"But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal.", 1
"Why, one may be accepted.", 1
"One usually is, I believe.", 1
"Then the excitement is all over.", 1
"The very essence of romance is uncertainty.", 1
"If ever I get married, I’ll certainly try to forget the fact.", 3
"I have no doubt about that, dear Algy.", 3
"The Divorce Court was specially invented for people whose memories are so curiously constituted.", 3
"Oh! there is no use speculating on that subject.", 1
"Divorces are made in Heaven—", 3
"Please don’t touch the cucumber sandwiches.", 1
"They are ordered specially for Aunt Augusta.", 1
"Well, you have been eating them all the time.", 1
"That is quite a different matter.", 3
"She is my aunt.", 1
"Have some bread and butter.", 1
"The bread and butter is for Gwendolen.", 1
"Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.", 1
"And very good bread and butter it is too.", 1
"Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it all.", 3
"You behave as if you were married to her already.", 3
"You are not married to her already, and I don’t think you ever will be.", 1
"Why on earth do you say that?", 1
"Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with.", 1
"Girls don’t think it right.", 1
"Oh, that is nonsense!", 1
"It is a great truth.", 3
"It accounts for the extraordinary number of bachelors that one sees all over the place.", 3
"In the second place, I don’t give my consent.", 1
"Your consent!", 1
"My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin.", 1
"And before I allow you to marry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily.", 1
"Cecily! What on earth do you mean?", 1
"What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily!", 1
"I don’t know any one of the name of Cecily.", 1
"Bring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-room the last time he dined here.", 1
"Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?", 1
"I wish to goodness you had let me know.", 1
"I have been writing frantic letters to Scotland Yard about it.", 1
"I was very nearly offering a large reward.", 1
"Well, I wish you would offer one.", 3
"I happen to be more than usually hard up.", 1
"There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.", 3
"I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say.", 3
"However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the inscription inside, I find that the thing isn’t yours after all.", 3
"Of course it’s mine.", 1
"You have seen me with it a hundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written inside.", 1
"It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case.", 1
"Oh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should read and what one shouldn’t.", 3
"More than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldn’t read.", 3
"I am quite aware of the fact, and I don’t propose to discuss modern culture.", 1
"It isn’t the sort of thing one should talk of in private.", 3
"I simply want my cigarette case back.", 1
"Yes; but this isn’t your cigarette case.", 1
"This cigarette case is a present from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn’t know any one of that name.", 1
"Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.", 1
"Your aunt!", 1
"Yes. Charming old lady she is, too.", 3
"Lives at Tunbridge Wells.", 1
"Just give it back to me, Algy.", 1
"But why does she call herself little Cecily if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells?", 1
"My dear fellow, what on earth is there in that?", 3
"Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall.", 1
"That is a matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself.", 3
"You seem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt!", 3
"That is absurd!", 1
"For Heaven’s sake give me back my cigarette case.", 1
"Yes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle?", 1
"Besides, your name isn’t Jack at all; it is Ernest.", 1
"It isn’t Ernest; it’s Jack.", 1
"You have always told me it was Ernest.", 1
"I have introduced you to every one as Ernest.", 1
"You answer to the name of Ernest.", 1
"You look as if your name was Ernest.", 3
"You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in my life.", 3
"It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn’t Ernest.", 1
"It’s on your cards.", 1
"Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the cigarette case was given to me in the country.", 1
"Yes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt Cecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle.", 1
"Come, old boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.", 1
"My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist.", 3
"It is very vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn’t a dentist.", 3
"It produces a false impression.", 1
"Well, that is exactly what dentists always do.", 3
"Now, go on! Tell me the whole thing.", 1
"I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a confirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it now.", 1
"Bunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?", 1
"I’ll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon as you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town and Jack in the country.", 1
"Well, produce my cigarette case first.", 1
"Here it is.", 1
"Now produce your explanation, and pray make it improbable.", 3
"My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at all.", 1
"In fact it’s perfectly ordinary.", 1
"Where is that place in the country, by the way?", 1
"That is nothing to you, dear boy.", 3
"You are not going to be invited . . .", 1
"I may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.", 1
"I suspected that, my dear fellow!", 1
"I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire on two separate occasions.", 3
"Why are you Ernest in town and Jack in the country?", 1
"My dear Algy, I don’t know whether you will be able to understand my real motives.", 1
"You are hardly serious enough.", 3
"When one is placed in the position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects.", 1
"It’s one’s duty to do so.", 1
"That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and simple.", 3
"The truth is rarely pure and never simple.", 3
"Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!", 3
"That wouldn’t be at all a bad thing.", 3
"Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow.", 1
"You should leave that to people who haven’t been at a University.", 3
"They do it so well in the daily papers.", 3
"What you really are is a Bunburyist.", 1
"I was quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist.", 1
"You are one of the most advanced Bunburyists I know.", 3
"What on earth do you mean?", 1
"You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like.", 1
"I have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose.", 1
"Bunbury is perfectly invaluable.", 1
"I haven’t asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.", 1
"You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations.", 3
"It is very foolish of you.", 1
"Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving invitations.", 3
"You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.", 1
"I haven’t the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind.", 1
"To begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to dine with one’s own relations.", 3
"That is not very pleasant.", 1
"Indeed, it is not even decent . . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase.", 1
"The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous.", 3
"It looks so bad.", 1
"It is simply washing one’s clean linen in public.", 3
"Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying.", 1
"I want to tell you the rules.", 1
"I’m not a Bunburyist at all.", 1
"Cecily is a little too much interested in him.", 1
"It is rather a bore.", 1
"So I am going to get rid of Ernest.", 1
"And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr. . . . with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.", 1
"A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very tedious time of it.", 3
"That is nonsense.", 1
"Then your wife will.", 3
"You don’t seem to realise, that in married life three is company and two is none.", 3
"Yes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.", 3
"For heaven’s sake, don’t try to be cynical.", 1
"It’s perfectly easy to be cynical.", 3
"My dear fellow, it isn’t easy to be anything nowadays.", 3
"There’s such a lot of beastly competition about.", 1
"Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta.", 1
"Only relatives, or creditors, ever ring in that Wagnerian manner.", 3
"Yes, but you must be serious about it.", 1
"I hate people who are not serious about meals.", 3
"It is so shallow of them.", 3
"Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well.", 3
"I’m feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.", 1
"That’s not quite the same thing.", 3
"In fact the two things rarely go together.", 3
"Dear me, you are smart!", 1
"I am always smart!", 1
"You’re quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.", 1
"Oh! I hope I am not that.", 3
"I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years younger.", 3
"And now I’ll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber sandwiches you promised me.", 1
"Certainly, Aunt Augusta.", 1
"Won’t you come and sit here, Gwendolen?", 1
"Thanks, mamma, I’m quite comfortable where I am.", 3
"Good heavens! Lane! Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?", 1
"I ordered them specially.", 1
"There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir.", 1
"I went down twice.", 1
"No cucumbers!", 1
"Not even for ready money.", 1
"That will do, Lane, thank you.", 1
"Thank you, sir.", 1
"I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no cucumbers, not even for ready money.", 3
"It really makes no matter, Algernon.", 1
"I had some crumpets with Lady Harbury, who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.", 3
"I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.", 3
"It certainly has changed its colour.", 1
"From what cause I, of course, cannot say.", 3
"I’ve quite a treat for you to-night, Algernon.", 1
"I am going to send you down with Mary Farquhar.", 1
"She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband.", 3
"It’s delightful to watch them.", 3
"I am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the pleasure of dining with you to-night after all.", 1
"I hope not, Algernon.", 1
"It would put my table completely out.", 1
"Your uncle would have to dine upstairs.", 1
"Fortunately he is accustomed to that.", 3
"They seem to think I should be with him.", 3
"It is very strange.", 1
"This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad health.", 3
"Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.", 3
"Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die.", 3
"This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd.", 1
"Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids.", 1
"I consider it morbid.", 1
"Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.", 3
"Health is the primary duty of life.", 1
"Of course the music is a great difficulty.", 1
"You see, if one plays good music, people don’t listen, and if one plays bad music people don’t talk.", 3
"But I’ll run over the programme I’ve drawn out, if you will kindly come into the next room for a moment.", 1
"Thank you, Algernon.", 1
"It is very thoughtful of you.", 1
"I’m sure the programme will be delightful, after a few expurgations.", 3
"French songs I cannot possibly allow.", 1
"People always seem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh, which is worse.", 1
"But German sounds a thoroughly respectable language, and indeed, I believe is so.", 3
"Gwendolen, you will accompany me.", 1
"Certainly, mamma.", 1
"Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.", 1
"Pray don’t talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing.", 1
"Whenever people talk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that they mean something else.", 3
"And that makes me so nervous.", 1
"I do mean something else.", 1
"I thought so.", 1
"In fact, I am never wrong.", 3
"Mamma has a way of coming back suddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her about.", 1
"Yes, I am quite well aware of the fact.", 1
"And I often wish that in public, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative.", 3
"For me you have always had an irresistible fascination.", 1
"Even before I met you I was far from indifferent to you.", 3
"We live, as I hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals.", 1
"There is something in that name that inspires absolute confidence.", 1
"The moment Algernon first mentioned to me that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love you.", 1
"You really love me, Gwendolen?", 1
"Passionately!", 1
"Darling! You don’t know how happy you’ve made me.", 1
"My own Ernest!", 1
"But your name is Ernest.", 1
"Yes, I know it is.", 1
"But supposing it was something else?", 1
"Do you mean to say you couldn’t love me then?", 1
"It suits you perfectly.", 1
"It is a divine name.", 1
"It has a music of its own.", 1
"It produces vibrations.", 1
"Well, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of other much nicer names.", 1
"I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.", 1
"It does not thrill.", 1
"It produces absolutely no vibrations . . .", 1
"Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for John!", 1
"The only really safe name is Ernest.", 1
"There is no time to be lost.", 1
"Married, Mr. Worthing?", 1
"Well . . . surely.", 1
"I adore you.", 1
"But you haven’t proposed to me yet.", 1
"Nothing has been said at all about marriage.", 1
"The subject has not even been touched on.", 1
"Well . . . may I propose to you now?", 1
"I think it would be an admirable opportunity.", 1
"Gwendolen!", 1
"Yes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?", 1
"You know what I have got to say to you.", 1
"Yes, but you don’t say it.", 1
"Gwendolen, will you marry me?", 1
"Of course I will, darling.", 1
"How long you have been about it!", 1
"I am afraid you have had very little experience in how to propose.", 3
"My own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.", 1
"Yes, but men often propose for practice.", 1
"I know my brother Gerald does.", 1
"All my girl-friends tell me so.", 1
"What wonderfully blue eyes you have, Ernest!", 1
"They are quite, quite, blue.", 1
"Mr. Worthing! Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture.", 1
"It is most indecorous.", 1
"Mamma! I must beg you to retire.", 1
"This is no place for you.", 3
"Finished what, may I ask?", 1
"I am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma.", 1
"Pardon me, you are not engaged to any one.", 1
"And now I have a few questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing.", 1
"While I am making these inquiries, you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the carriage.", 1
"In the carriage, Gwendolen!", 1
"Gwendolen, the carriage!", 1
"Yes, mamma.", 1
"You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.", 1
"Thank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.", 1
"We work together, in fact.", 1
"Do you smoke?", 1
"Well, yes, I must admit I smoke.", 1
"There are far too many idle men in London as it is.", 1
"How old are you?", 1
"Twenty-nine.", 1
"A very good age to be married at.", 1
"Which do you know?", 1
"The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound.", 1
"What is your income?", 1
"Between seven and eight thousand a year.", 1
"In land, or in investments?", 1
"In investments, chiefly.", 1
"That is satisfactory.", 1
"It gives one position, and prevents one from keeping it up.", 1
"That’s all that can be said about land.", 1
"A country house!", 1
"How many bedrooms?", 1
"Well, that point can be cleared up afterwards.", 1
"You have a town house, I hope?", 1
"Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year to Lady Bloxham.", 1
"Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at six months’ notice.", 1
"Lady Bloxham? I don’t know her.", 1
"Oh, she goes about very little.", 1
"She is a lady considerably advanced in years.", 1
"What number in Belgrave Square?", 1
"The unfashionable side.", 1
"However, that could easily be altered.", 1
"Do you mean the fashion, or the side?", 1
"What are your politics?", 1
"Well, I am afraid I really have none.", 1
"I am a Liberal Unionist.", 1
"Oh, they count as Tories.", 1
"They dine with us.", 1
"Or come in the evening, at any rate.", 1
"Now to minor matters.", 1
"Are your parents living?", 1
"I have lost both my parents.", 1
"Who was your father?", 1
"He was evidently a man of some wealth.", 1
"I am afraid I really don’t know.", 1
"The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I had lost my parents.", 1
"I don’t actually know who I am by birth.", 1
"I was . . . well, I was found.", 1
"Found!", 1
"Worthing is a place in Sussex.", 1
"It is a seaside resort.", 1
"Where did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class ticket for this seaside resort find you?", 1
"In a hand-bag.", 1
"A hand-bag?", 1
"Yes, Lady Bracknell.", 1
"In what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas, Cardew come across this ordinary hand-bag?", 1
"In the cloak-room at Victoria Station.", 1
"It was given to him in mistake for his own.", 1
"The cloak-room at Victoria Station?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"The Brighton line.", 1
"The line is immaterial.", 1
"Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel somewhat bewildered by what you have just told me.", 1
"And I presume you know what that unfortunate movement led to?", 1
"May I ask you then what you would advise me to do?", 1
"I need hardly say I would do anything in the world to ensure Gwendolen’s happiness.", 1
"Well, I don’t see how I could possibly manage to do that.", 1
"I can produce the hand-bag at any moment.", 1
"It is in my dressing-room at home.", 1
"I really think that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.", 1
"Me, sir! What has it to do with me?", 3
"Good morning, Mr. Worthing!", 1
"Good morning!", 1
"For goodness’ sake don’t play that ghastly tune, Algy.", 1
"How idiotic you are!", 1
"Didn’t it go off all right, old boy?", 1
"You don’t mean to say Gwendolen refused you?", 1
"I know it is a way she has.", 1
"She is always refusing people.", 1
"I think it is most ill-natured of her.", 1
"Oh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet.", 1
"As far as she is concerned, we are engaged.", 1
"Her mother is perfectly unbearable.", 1
"Never met such a Gorgon . . .", 1
"I beg your pardon, Algy, I suppose I shouldn’t talk about your own aunt in that way before you.", 1
"Oh, that is nonsense!", 1
"It isn’t!", 1
"Well, I won’t argue about the matter.", 1
"You always want to argue about things.", 1
"Is that clever?", 1
"It is perfectly phrased!", 1
"I am sick to death of cleverness.", 1
"Everybody is clever nowadays.", 1
"You can’t go anywhere without meeting clever people.", 1
"The thing has become an absolute public nuisance.", 1
"I wish to goodness we had a few fools left.", 1
"We have.", 3
"I should extremely like to meet them.", 1
"What do they talk about?", 1
"What fools!", 1
"By the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being Ernest in town, and Jack in the country?", 1
"Oh, that is nonsense.", 1
"What about your brother?", 1
"What about the profligate Ernest?", 1
"Oh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him.", 1
"I’ll say he died in Paris of apoplexy.", 1
"Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite suddenly, don’t they?", 1
"It’s a sort of thing that runs in families.", 1
"You had much better say a severe chill.", 1
"You are sure a severe chill isn’t hereditary, or anything of that kind?", 1
"Of course it isn’t!", 1
"Very well, then.", 1
"My poor brother Ernest is carried off suddenly, in Paris, by a severe chill.", 1
"That gets rid of him.", 1
"Won’t she feel his loss a good deal?", 1
"Oh, that is all right.", 1
"Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am glad to say.", 1
"She has got a capital appetite, goes long walks, and pays no attention at all to her lessons.", 1
"I would rather like to see Cecily.", 1
"I will take very good care you never do.", 1
"She is excessively pretty, and she is only just eighteen.", 1
"Have you told Gwendolen yet that you have an excessively pretty ward who is only just eighteen?", 1
"Cecily and Gwendolen are perfectly certain to be extremely great friends.", 1
"I’ll bet you anything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be calling each other sister.", 1
"Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at Willis’s, we really must go and dress.", 1
"Do you know it is nearly seven?", 1
"Well, I’m hungry.", 1
"What shall we do after dinner?", 1
"Go to a theatre?", 1
"Oh no! I loathe listening.", 1
"Well, let us go to the Club?", 1
"Oh, no! I hate talking.", 1
"Well, we might trot round to the Empire at ten?", 1
"Oh, no! I can’t bear looking at things.", 1
"It is so silly.", 1
"Well, what shall we do?", 1
"Nothing!", 1
"Miss Fairfax.", 1
"Gwendolen, upon my word!", 1
"Algy, kindly turn your back.", 1
"I have something very particular to say to Mr. Worthing.", 1
"Really, Gwendolen, I don’t think I can allow this at all.", 1
"Algy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards life.", 1
"My own darling!", 1
"Ernest, we may never be married.", 1
"From the expression on mamma’s face I fear we never shall.", 1
"Few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their children say to them.", 1
"The old-fashioned respect for the young is fast dying out.", 1
"Whatever influence I ever had over mamma, I lost at the age of three.", 1
"Dear Gwendolen!", 1
"Your Christian name has an irresistible fascination.", 1
"Your town address at the Albany I have.", 1
"What is your address in the country?", 1
"The Manor House, Woolton, Hertfordshire.", 1
"There is a good postal service, I suppose?", 1
"It may be necessary to do something desperate.", 1
"That of course will require serious consideration.", 1
"I will communicate with you daily.", 1
"My own one!", 1
"How long do you remain in town?", 1
"Till Monday.", 1
"Good! Algy, you may turn round now.", 1
"Thanks, I’ve turned round already.", 1
"You may also ring the bell.", 1
"You will let me see you to your carriage, my own darling?", 1
"Certainly.", 1
"I will see Miss Fairfax out.", 1
"Yes, sir.", 1
"A glass of sherry, Lane.", 1
"Yes, sir.", 1
"To-morrow, Lane, I’m going Bunburying.", 3
"Yes, sir.", 1
"I shall probably not be back till Monday.", 1
"Yes, sir.", 1
"I hope to-morrow will be a fine day, Lane.", 1
"It never is, sir.", 3
"Lane, you’re a perfect pessimist.", 1
"I do my best to give satisfaction, sir.", 3
"There’s a sensible, intellectual girl! the only girl I ever cared for in my life.", 1
"What on earth are you so amused at?", 1
"If you don’t take care, your friend Bunbury will get you into a serious scrape some day.", 1
"I love scrapes.", 1
"They are the only things that are never serious.", 3
"Oh, that’s nonsense, Algy.", 1
"You never talk anything but nonsense.", 1
"Nobody ever does.", 3
"The country was apparently tranquil.", 1
"The Cuban and Hawaiian investments had paid one hundred per cent and the territory of Samoa was well worth its cost as a coaling station.", 1
"The country was in a superb state of defence.", 1
"The nation was prosperous; Chicago, for a moment paralyzed after a second great fire, had risen from its ruins, white and imperial, and more beautiful than the white city which had been built for its plaything in 1893.", 1
"Everywhere good architecture was replacing bad, and even in New York, a sudden craving for decency had swept away a great portion of the existing horrors.", 1
"Streets had been widened, properly paved and lighted, trees had been planted, squares laid out, elevated structures demolished and underground roads built to replace them.", 1
"The new government buildings and barracks were fine bits of architecture, and the long system of stone quays which completely surrounded the island had been turned into parks which proved a god-send to the population.", 1
"The subsidizing of the state theatre and state opera brought its own reward.", 1
"The United States National Academy of Design was much like European institutions of the same kind.", 1
"Nobody envied the Secretary of Fine Arts, either his cabinet position or his portfolio.", 3
"The Secretary of Forestry and Game Preservation had a much easier time, thanks to the new system of National Mounted Police.", 1
"In the city of New York the summer of 1899 was signalized by the dismantling of the Elevated Railroads.", 1
"The summer of 1900 will live in the memories of New York people for many a cycle; the Dodge Statue was removed in that year.", 1
"I had walked down that day from Dr. Archer's house on Madison Avenue, where I had been as a mere formality.", 1
"It was hardly worth his fee to be told that; I knew it myself.", 1
"Still I did not grudge him the money.", 1
"What I minded was the mistake which he made at first.", 1
"At last he decided that I was well, and I, knowing that my mind had always been as sound as his, if not sounder, 'paid my tuition' as he jokingly called it, and left.", 1
"I told him, smiling, that I would get even with him for his mistake, and he laughed heartily, and asked me to call once in a while.", 1
"I did so, hoping for a chance to even up accounts, but he gave me none, and I told him I would wait.", 1
"The fall from my horse had fortunately left no evil results; on the contrary it had changed my whole character for the better.", 1
"From a lazy young man about town, I had become active, energetic, temperate, and above all--oh, above all else--ambitious.", 1
"There was only one thing which troubled me, I laughed at my own uneasiness, and yet it troubled me.", 1
"During my convalescence I had bought and read for the first time, The King in Yellow.", 1
"I remember after finishing the first act that it occurred to me that I had better stop.", 1
"I started up and flung the book into the fireplace; the volume struck the barred grate and fell open on the hearth in the firelight.", 1
"It was, I remember, the 13th day of April, 1920, that the first Government Lethal Chamber was established on the south side of Washington Square, between Wooster Street and South Fifth Avenue.", 1
"The block which had formerly consisted of a lot of shabby old buildings, used as cafés and restaurants for foreigners, had been acquired by the Government in the winter of 1898.", 1
"The French and Italian cafés and restaurants were torn down; the whole block was enclosed by a gilded iron railing, and converted into a lovely garden with lawns, flowers and fountains.", 1
"In the centre of the garden stood a small, white building, severely classical in architecture, and surrounded by thickets of flowers.", 1
"Six Ionic columns supported the roof, and the single door was of bronze.", 1
"A splendid marble group of the 'Fates' stood before the door, the work of a young American sculptor, Boris Yvain, who had died in Paris when only twenty-three years old.", 1
"The inauguration ceremonies were in progress as I crossed University Place and entered the square.", 1
"I threaded my way through the silent throng of spectators, but was stopped at Fourth Street by a cordon of police.", 1
"A regiment of United States lancers were drawn up in a hollow square round the Lethal Chamber.", 1
"The tribune was surrounded by a squadron of hussars of the National Guard.", 1
"The Governor was finishing his reply to the short speech of the Surgeon-General.", 1
"The Government has seen fit to acknowledge the right of man to end an existence which may have become intolerable to him, through physical suffering or mental despair.", 1
"It is believed that the community will be benefited by the removal of such people from their midst.", 1
"Since the passage of this law, the number of suicides in the United States has not increased.", 1
"He paused, and turned to the white Lethal Chamber.", 1
"The silence in the street was absolute.", 1
"'There a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life.", 1
"'If death is welcome let him seek it there.'", 1
"I left the crowd to gape and stare at the white marble Death Chamber, and, crossing South Fifth Avenue, walked along the western side of that thoroughfare to Bleecker Street.", 1
"Then I turned to the right and stopped before a dingy shop which bore the sign: HAWBERK, ARMOURER.", 1
"I glanced in at the doorway and saw Hawberk busy in his little shop at the end of the hall.", 1
"He looked up, and catching sight of me cried in his deep, hearty voice, 'Come in, Mr. Castaigne!'", 1
"I smiled at her confusion and complimented her on the banner she was embroidering from a coloured plate.", 1
"Old Hawberk sat riveting the worn greaves of some ancient suit of armour, and the ting! ting! ting! of his little hammer sounded pleasantly in the quaint shop.", 1
"Presently he dropped his hammer, and fussed about for a moment with a tiny wrench.", 1
"The soft clash of the mail sent a thrill of pleasure through me.", 1
"I loved to hear the music of steel brushing against steel, the mellow shock of the mallet on thigh pieces, and the jingle of chain armour.", 1
"That was the only reason I went to see Hawberk.", 1
"He had never interested me personally, nor did Constance, except for the fact of her being in love with Louis.", 1
"This did occupy my attention, and sometimes even kept me awake at night.", 1
"But I knew in my heart that all would come right, and that I should arrange their future as I expected to arrange that of my kind doctor, John Archer.", 3
"However, I should never have troubled myself about visiting them just then, had it not been, as I say, that the music of the tinkling hammer had for me this strong fascination.", 1
"I would sit for hours, listening and listening, and when a stray sunbeam struck the inlaid steel, the sensation it gave me was almost too keen to endure.", 1
"Constance worked with the embroidery over her knees, now and then pausing to examine more closely the pattern in the coloured plate from the Metropolitan Museum.", 1
"'Who is this for?' I asked.", 1
"This was the missing greave of a famous suit which a client of his had traced to a little shop in Paris on the Quai d'Orsay.", 1
"He, Hawberk, had negotiated for and secured the greave, and now the suit was complete.", 1
"He laid down his hammer and read me the history of the suit, traced since 1450 from owner to owner until it was acquired by Thomas Stainbridge.", 1
"'Did you continue the search so persistently without any certainty of the greave being still in existence?' I demanded.", 1
"'Of course,' he replied coolly.", 1
"Then for the first time I took a personal interest in Hawberk.", 1
"'It was worth something to you,' I ventured.", 1
"'No,' he replied, laughing, 'my pleasure in finding it was my reward.'", 1
"'Have you no ambition to be rich?' I asked, smiling.", 1
"'My one ambition is to be the best armourer in the world,' he answered gravely.", 1
"Constance asked me if I had seen the ceremonies at the Lethal Chamber.", 1
"'Did you see your cousin, Mr. Castaigne, there?' she asked, with the slightest tremor of her soft eyelashes.", 1
"'No,' I replied carelessly.", 1
"Louis' regiment is manoeuvring out in Westchester County.'", 1
"I rose and picked up my hat and cane.", 1
"If Hawberk knew how I loathe that word 'lunatic,' he would never use it in my presence.", 1
"It rouses certain feelings within me which I do not care to explain.", 1
"However, I answered him quietly: 'I think I shall drop in and see Mr. Wilde for a moment or two.'", 1
"'Poor fellow,' said Constance, with a shake of the head, 'it must be hard to live alone year after year poor, crippled and almost demented.", 1
"It is very good of you, Mr. Castaigne, to visit him as often as you do.'", 1
"'I think he is vicious,' observed Hawberk, beginning again with his hammer.", 1
"I listened to the golden tinkle on the greave plates; when he had finished I replied:", 1
"'No, he is not vicious, nor is he in the least demented.", 1
"His mind is a wonder chamber, from which he can extract treasures that you and I would give years of our life to acquire.''", 1
"Hawberk laughed.", 1
"I continued a little impatiently: 'He knows history as no one else could know it.", 1
"Nothing, however trivial, escapes his search, and his memory is so absolute, so precise in details, that were it known in New York that such a man existed, the people could not honour him enough.'", 1
"'Nonsense,' muttered Hawberk, searching on the floor for a fallen rivet.", 1
"Hawberk's hammer fell to the ground, but he picked it up and asked, with a great deal of calm, how I knew that the tassets and left cuissard were missing from the 'Prince's Emblazoned.'", 1
"'I did not know until Mr. Wilde mentioned it to me the other day.", 1
"He said they were in the garret of 998 Pell Street.'", 1
"'Nonsense,' he cried, but I noticed his hand trembling under his leathern apron.", 1
"I did not finish, for Constance had started to her feet with terror written on every feature.", 1
"Hawberk looked at me and slowly smoothed his leathern apron.", 1
"'That is impossible,' he observed, 'Mr. Wilde may know a great many things--'", 1
"'About armour, for instance, and the 'Prince's Emblazoned,'' I interposed, smiling.", 1
"'Mr. Wilde is wrong,' murmured Constance.", 1
"Her lips were blanched, but her voice was sweet and calm.", 1
"'Let us agree, if you please, that in this one circumstance Mr. Wilde is wrong,' I said.", 3
"Almustafa, the chosen and the beloved, who was a dawn unto his own day, had waited twelve years in the city of Orphalese for his ship that was to return and bear him back to the isle of his birth.", 1
"And in the twelfth year, on the seventh day of Ielool, the month of reaping, he climbed the hill without the city walls and looked seaward; and he beheld his ship coming with the mist.", 1
"Then the gates of his heart were flung open, and his joy flew far over the sea.", 3
"And he closed his eyes and prayed in the silences of his soul.", 1
"But as he descended the hill, a sadness came upon him, and he thought in his heart:", 1
"How shall I go in peace and without sorrow?", 3
"Nay, not without a wound in the spirit shall I leave this city.", 3
"Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret?", 3
"Too many fragments of the spirit have I scattered in these streets, and too many are the children of my longing that walk naked among these hills, and I cannot withdraw from them without a burden and an ache.", 3
"It is not a garment I cast off this day, but a skin that I tear with my own hands.", 3
"Nor is it a thought I leave behind me, but a heart made sweet with hunger and with thirst.", 3
"Yet I cannot tarry longer.", 1
"The sea that calls all things unto her calls me, and I must embark.", 3
"For to stay, though the hours burn in the night, is to freeze and crystallize and be bound in a mould.", 3
"Fain would I take with me all that is here.", 1
"But how shall I?", 3
"A voice cannot carry the tongue and the lips that gave it wings.", 3
"Alone must it seek the ether.", 3
"And alone and without his nest shall the eagle fly across the sun.", 3
"Now when he reached the foot of the hill, he turned again towards the sea, and he saw his ship approaching the harbour, and upon her prow the mariners, the men of his own land.", 1
"And his soul cried out to them, and he said:", 1
"Sons of my ancient mother, you riders of the tides,", 1
"How often have you sailed in my dreams.", 1
"And now you come in my awakening, which is my deeper dream.", 3
"Ready am I to go, and my eagerness with sails full set awaits the wind.", 3
"Only another breath will I breathe in this still air, only another loving look cast backward,", 1
"And then I shall stand among you, a seafarer among seafarers.", 1
"Who alone are peace and freedom to the river and the stream,", 3
"Only another winding will this stream make, only another murmur in this glade,", 1
"And then shall I come to you, a boundless drop to a boundless ocean.", 3
"And as he walked he saw from afar men and women leaving their fields and their vineyards and hastening towards the city gates.", 1
"And he heard their voices calling his name, and shouting from field to field telling one another of the coming of his ship.", 1
"And he said to himself:", 1
"Shall the day of parting be the day of gathering?", 3
"And shall it be said that my eve was in truth my dawn?", 3
"And what shall I give unto him who has left his plough in midfurrow, or to him who has stopped the wheel of his winepress?", 3
"Shall my heart become a tree heavy-laden with fruit that I may gather and give unto them?", 3
"And shall my desires flow like a fountain that I may fill their cups?", 3
"Am I a harp that the hand of the mighty may touch me, or a flute that his breath may pass through me?", 3
"A seeker of silences am I, and what treasure have I found in silences that I may dispense with confidence?", 3
"If this is my day of harvest, in what fields have I sowed the seed, and in what unremembered seasons?", 3
"If this indeed be the hour in which I lift up my lantern, it is not my flame that shall burn therein.", 3
"Empty and dark shall I raise my lantern,", 1
"And the guardian of the night shall fill it with oil and he shall light it also.", 3
"These things he said in words.", 1
"But much in his heart remained unsaid.", 1
"For he himself could not speak his deeper secret.", 3
"And when he entered into the city all the people came to meet him, and they were crying out to him as with one voice.", 1
"And the elders of the city stood forth and said:", 1
"Go not yet away from us.", 1
"A noontide have you been in our twilight, and your youth has given us dreams to dream.", 3
"No stranger are you among us, nor a guest, but our son and our dearly beloved.", 1
"Suffer not yet our eyes to hunger for your face.", 3
"And the priests and the priestesses said unto him:", 1
"Let not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent in our midst become a memory.", 3
"You have walked among us a spirit, and your shadow has been a light upon our faces.", 3
"Much have we loved you.", 1
"But speechless was our love, and with veils has it been veiled.", 3
"Yet now it cries aloud unto you, and would stand revealed before you.", 1
"And ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.", 3
"And others came also and entreated him.", 1
"But he answered them not.", 1
"He only bent his head; and those who stood near saw his tears falling upon his breast.", 1
"And he and the people proceeded towards the great square before the temple.", 1
"And there came out of the sanctuary a woman whose name was Almitra.", 1
"And she was a seeress.", 1
"And he looked upon her with exceeding tenderness, for it was she who had first sought and believed in him when he had been but a day in their city.", 1
"Prophet of God, in quest of the uttermost, long have you searched the distances for your ship.", 1
"And now your ship has come, and you must needs go.", 1
"Deep is your longing for the land of your memories and the dwelling place of your greater desires; and our love would not bind you nor our needs hold you.", 1
"Yet this we ask ere you leave us, that you speak to us and give us of your truth.", 1
"And we will give it unto our children, and they unto their children, and it shall not perish.", 1
"In your aloneness you have watched with our days, and in your wakefulness you have listened to the weeping and the laughter of our sleep.", 1
"Now therefore disclose us to ourselves, and tell us all that has been shown you of that which is between birth and death.", 1
"People of Orphalese, of what can I speak save of that which is even now moving within your souls?", 3
"Then said Almitra, Speak to us of Love.", 1
"And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them.", 1
"And with a great voice he said:", 1
"When love beckons to you, follow him,", 3
"Though his ways are hard and steep.", 3
"And when his wings enfold you yield to him,", 3
"Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.", 3
"And when he speaks to you believe in him,", 3
"Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.", 3
"For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.", 3
"Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.", 3
"Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself.", 3
"He threshes you to make you naked.", 3
"He sifts you to free you from your husks.", 3
"He grinds you to whiteness.", 3
"He kneads you until you are pliant;", 1
"And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God’s sacred feast.", 3
"All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life’s heart.", 3
"But if in your fear you would seek only love’s peace and love’s pleasure,", 1
"Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love’s threshing-floor,", 1
"Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.", 3
"Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.", 3
"Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;", 3
"For love is sufficient unto love.", 3
"When you love you should not say, “God is in my heart,” but rather, “I am in the heart of God.”", 3
"And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.", 3
"Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.", 3
"But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:", 1
"To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.", 3
"To know the pain of too much tenderness.", 3
"To be wounded by your own understanding of love;", 1
"And to bleed willingly and joyfully.", 1
"To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;", 3
"To rest at the noon hour and meditate love’s ecstacy;", 1
"To return home at eventide with gratitude;", 1
"And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.", 1
"You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.", 1
"You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days.", 3
"Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.", 3
"But let there be spaces in your togetherness,", 1
"And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.", 3
"Love one another, but make not a bond of love:", 3
"Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.", 3
"Fill each other’s cup but drink not from one cup.", 1
"Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.", 1
"Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,", 1
"Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.", 3
"Give your hearts, but not into each other’s keeping.", 1
"For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.", 3
"And stand together yet not too near together:", 1
"For the pillars of the temple stand apart,", 1
"And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other’s shadow.", 3
"And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children.", 1
"Your children are not your children.", 3
"They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.", 3
"They come through you but not from you,", 1
"And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.", 1
"You may give them your love but not your thoughts,", 1
"For they have their own thoughts.", 1
"You may house their bodies but not their souls,", 1
"For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.", 3
"You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.", 1
"For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.", 3
"You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.", 3
"The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.", 3
"Let your bending in the Archer’s hand be for gladness;", 1
"For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.", 3
"You give but little when you give of your possessions.", 3
"It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.", 3
"For what are your possessions but things you keep and guard for fear you may need them tomorrow?", 3
"And tomorrow, what shall tomorrow bring to the overprudent dog burying bones in the trackless sand as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city?", 3
"And what is fear of need but need itself?", 3
"Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, the thirst that is unquenchable?", 3
"These are the believers in life and the bounty of life, and their coffer is never empty.", 3
"There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward.", 1
"And there are those who give with pain, and that pain is their baptism.", 1
"They give as in yonder valley the myrtle breathes its fragrance into space.", 3
"Through the hands of such as these God speaks, and from behind their eyes He smiles upon the earth.", 3
"It is well to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through understanding;", 1
"And to the open-handed the search for one who shall receive is joy greater than giving.", 3
"And is there aught you would withhold?", 1
"All you have shall some day be given;", 1
"Therefore give now, that the season of giving may be yours and not your inheritors’.", 1
"The trees in your orchard say not so, nor the flocks in your pasture.", 1
"They give that they may live, for to withhold is to perish.", 3
"Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and his nights, is worthy of all else from you.", 3
"And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream.", 3
"And what desert greater shall there be, than that which lies in the courage and the confidence, nay the charity, of receiving?", 3
"See first that you yourself deserve to be a giver, and an instrument of giving.", 1
"For in truth it is life that gives unto life--while you, who deem yourself a giver, are but a witness.", 3
"Rather rise together with the giver on his gifts as on wings;", 3
"For to be overmindful of your debt, is to doubt his generosity who has the freehearted earth for mother, and God for father.", 3
"Would that you could live on the fragrance of the earth, and like an air plant be sustained by the light.", 3
"But since you must kill to eat, and rob the newly born of its mother’s milk to quench your thirst, let it then be an act of worship,", 3
"And let your board stand an altar on which the pure and the innocent of forest and plain are sacrificed for that which is purer and still more innocent in man.", 3
"When you kill a beast say to him in your heart,", 1
"Your blood and my blood is naught but the sap that feeds the tree of heaven.”", 3
"And when you crush an apple with your teeth, say to it in your heart,", 1
"“Your seeds shall live in my body,", 1
"And the buds of your tomorrow shall blossom in my heart,", 3
"And your fragrance shall be my breath,", 1
"And together we shall rejoice through all the seasons.”", 1
"“I too am a vineyard, and my fruit shall be gathered for the winepress,", 3
"And like new wine I shall be kept in eternal vessels.”", 3
"And in winter, when you draw the wine, let there be in your heart a song for each cup;", 1
"And let there be in the song a remembrance for the autumn days, and for the vineyard, and for the winepress.", 1
"You work that you may keep pace with the earth and the soul of the earth.", 3
"For to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons, and to step out of life’s procession, that marches in majesty and proud submission towards the infinite.", 3
"When you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the hours turns to music.", 3
"Which of you would be a reed, dumb and silent, when all else sings together in unison?", 3
"Always you have been told that work is a curse and labour a misfortune.", 1
"And in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life,", 1
"And to love life through labour is to be intimate with life’s inmost secret.", 1
"But if you in your pain call birth an affliction and the support of the flesh a curse written upon your brow, then I answer that naught but the sweat of your brow shall wash away that which is written.", 3
"You have been told also that life is darkness, and in your weariness you echo what was said by the weary.", 1
"And I say that life is indeed darkness ‘save when there is urge,", 1
"And all urge is blind save when there is knowledge,", 1
"And all knowledge is vain save when there is work,", 1
"And all work is empty save when there is love;", 1
"And when you work with love you bind yourself to yourself, and to one another, and to God.", 1
"And what is it to work with love?", 1
"It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth.", 3
"It is to build a house with affection, even as if your beloved were to dwell in that house.", 3
"It is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy, even as if your beloved were to eat the fruit.", 3
"It is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own spirit,", 3
"And to know that all the blessed dead are standing about you and watching.", 3
"And he alone is great who turns the voice of the wind into a song made sweeter by his own loving.", 3
"Work is love made visible.", 3
"And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy.", 1
"For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half man’s hunger.", 3
"And if you grudge the crushing of the grapes, your grudge distils a poison in the wine.", 3
"And if you sing though as angels, and love not the singing, you muffle man’s ears to the voices of the day and the voices of the night.", 3
"Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.", 3
"And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.", 3
"And how else can it be?", 3
"The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.", 3
"Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter’s oven?", 3
"And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?", 3
"When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.", 1
"When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.", 1
"But I say unto you, they are inseparable.", 1
"Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.", 3
"Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.", 3
"Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.", 3
"When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.", 3
"Build of your imaginings a bower in the wilderness ere you build a house within the city walls.", 3
"For even as you have home-comings in your twilight, so has the wanderer in you, the ever distant and alone.", 3
"Your house is your larger body.", 3
"It grows in the sun and sleeps in the stillness of the night; and it is not dreamless.", 3
"Does not your house dream?", 3
"and dreaming, leave the city for grove or hilltop?", 3
"Would that I could gather your houses into my hand, and like a sower scatter them in forest and meadow.", 3
"Would the valleys were your streets, and the green paths your alleys, that you might seek one another through vineyards, and come with the fragrance of the earth in your garments.", 3
"But these things are not yet to be.", 1
"In their fear your forefathers gathered you too near together.", 1
"And that fear shall endure a little longer.", 1
"A little longer shall your city walls separate your hearths from your fields.", 1
"And tell me, people of Orphalese, what have you in these houses?", 1
"And what is it you guard with fastened doors?", 1
"Have you peace, the quiet urge that reveals your power?", 1
"Have you remembrances, the glimmering arches that span the summits of the mind?", 3
"Have you beauty, that leads the heart from things fashioned of wood and stone to the holy mountain?", 3
"Tell me, have you these in your houses?", 1
"Or have you only comfort, and the lust for comfort, that stealthy thing that enters the house a guest, and then becomes a host, and then a master?", 3
"Ay, and it becomes a tamer, and with hook and scourge makes puppets of your larger desires.", 3
"Though its hands are silken, its heart is of iron.", 3
"It lulls you to sleep only to stand by your bed and jeer at the dignity of the flesh.", 3
"It makes mock of your sound senses, and lays them in thistledown like fragile vessels.", 3
"Verily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul, and then walks grinning in the funeral.", 3
"But you, children of space, you restless in rest, you shall not be trapped nor tamed.", 3
"Your house shall be not an anchor but a mast.", 3
"It shall not be a glistening film that covers a wound, but an eyelid that guards the eye.", 3
"You shall not fold your wings that you may pass through doors, nor bend your heads that they strike not against a ceiling, nor fear to breathe lest walls should crack and fall down.", 3
"You shall not dwell in tombs made by the dead for the living.", 3
"And though of magnificence and splendour, your house shall not hold your secret nor shelter your longing.", 1
"For that which is boundless in you abides in the mansion of the sky, whose door is the morning mist, and whose windows are the songs and the silences of night.", 3
"Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.", 1
"And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain.", 3
"Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment,", 3
"For the breath of life is in the sunlight and the hand of life is in the wind.", 3
"And I say, Ay, it was the north wind,", 1
"But shame was his loom, and the softening of the sinews was his thread.", 3
"And when his work was done he laughed in the forest.", 1
"Forget not that modesty is for a shield against the eye of the unclean.", 3
"And when the unclean shall be no more, what were modesty but a fetter and a fouling of the mind?", 3
"And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.", 3
"To you the earth yields her fruit, and you shall not want if you but know how to fill your hands.", 1
"It is in exchanging the gifts of the earth that you shall find abundance and be satisfied.", 1
"Yet unless the exchange be in love and kindly justice, it will but lead some to greed and others to hunger.", 1
"Invoke then the master spirit of the earth, to come into your midst and sanctify the scales and the reckoning that weighs value against value.", 1
"And suffer not the barren-handed to take part in your transactions, who would sell their words for your labour.", 3
"To such men you should say,", 1
"“Come with us to the field, or go with our brothers to the sea and cast your net;", 1
"For the land and the sea shall be bountiful to you even as to us.”", 1
"And if there come the singers and the dancers and the flute players,--buy of their gifts also.", 1
"For they too are gatherers of fruit and frankincense, and that which they bring, though fashioned of dreams, is raiment and food for your soul.", 3
"And before you leave the market place, see that no one has gone his way with empty hands.", 1
"For the master spirit of the earth shall not sleep peacefully upon the wind till the needs of the least of you are satisfied.", 3
"It is when your spirit goes wandering upon the wind,", 3
"That you, alone and unguarded, commit a wrong unto others and therefore unto yourself.", 1
"And for that wrong committed must you knock and wait a while unheeded at the gate of the blessed.", 3
"Like the ocean is your god-self;", 3
"It remains for ever undefiled.", 1
"And like the ether it lifts but the winged.", 3
"Even like the sun is your god-self;", 3
"It knows not the ways of the mole nor seeks it the holes of the serpent.", 3
"But your god-self dwells not alone in your being.", 1
"Much in you is still man, and much in you is not yet man,", 1
"But a shapeless pigmy that walks asleep in the mist searching for its own awakening.", 3
"And of the man in you would I now speak.", 1
"For it is he and not your god-self nor the pigmy in the mist, that knows crime and the punishment of crime.", 1
"But I say that even as the holy and the righteous cannot rise beyond the highest which is in each one of you,", 1
"So the wicked and the weak cannot fall lower than the lowest which is in you also.", 1
"And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree,", 3
"Like a procession you walk together towards your god-self.", 3
"You are the way and the wayfarers.", 3
"And when one of you falls down he falls for those behind him, a caution against the stumbling stone.", 3
"Ay, and he falls for those ahead of him, who though faster and surer of foot, yet removed not the stumbling stone.", 1
"And this also, though the word lie heavy upon your hearts:", 1
"The murdered is not unaccountable for his own murder,", 3
"And the robbed is not blameless in being robbed.", 3
"The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked,", 3
"And the white-handed is not clean in the doings of the felon.", 3
"Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured,", 3
"And still more often the condemned is the burden bearer for the guiltless and unblamed.", 3
"You cannot separate the just from the unjust and the good from the wicked;", 1
"For they stand together before the face of the sun even as the black thread and the white are woven together.", 3
"And when the black thread breaks, the weaver shall look into the whole cloth, and he shall examine the loom also.", 3
"If any of you would bring to judgment the unfaithful wife,", 1
"Let him also weigh the heart of her husband in scales, and measure his soul with measurements.", 3
"And let him who would lash the offender look unto the spirit of the offended.", 1
"And if any of you would punish in the name of righteousness and lay the ax unto the evil tree, let him see to its roots;", 1
"And verily he will find the roots of the good and the bad, the fruitful and the fruitless, all entwined together in the silent heart of the earth.", 3
"What judgment pronounce you upon him who though honest in the flesh yet is a thief in spirit?", 3
"What penalty lay you upon him who slays in the flesh yet is himself slain in the spirit?", 3
"And how prosecute you him who in action is a deceiver and an oppressor,", 1
"Yet who also is aggrieved and outraged?", 1
"And how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than their misdeeds?", 3
"Is not remorse the justice which is administered by that very law which you would fain serve?", 3
"Yet you cannot lay remorse upon the innocent nor lift it from the heart of the guilty.", 1
"Unbidden shall it call in the night, that men may wake and gaze upon themselves.", 3
"And you who would understand justice, how shall you unless you look upon all deeds in the fullness of light?", 3
"And that the corner-stone of the temple is not higher than the lowest stone in its foundation.", 3
"You delight in laying down laws,", 1
"Yet you delight more in breaking them.", 1
"Like children playing by the ocean who build sand-towers with constancy and then destroy them with laughter.", 3
"But while you build your sand-towers the ocean brings more sand to the shore,", 1
"And when you destroy them the ocean laughs with you.", 3
"Verily the ocean laughs always with the innocent.", 3
"But what of those to whom life is not an ocean, and man-made laws are not sand-towers,", 3
"But to whom life is a rock, and the law a chisel with which they would carve it in their own likeness?", 3
"What of the cripple who hates dancers?", 3
"What of the ox who loves his yoke and deems the elk and deer of the forest stray and vagrant things?", 3
"What of the old serpent who cannot shed his skin, and calls all others naked and shameless?", 3
"What shall I say of these save that they too stand in the sunlight, but with their backs to the sun?", 1
"They see only their shadows, and their shadows are their laws.", 3
"And what is the sun to them but a caster of shadows?", 3
"And what is it to acknowledge the laws but to stoop down and trace their shadows upon the earth?", 1
"But you who walk facing the sun, what images drawn on the earth can hold you?", 3
"You who travel with the wind, what weather-vane shall direct your course?", 3
"What man’s law shall bind you if you break your yoke but upon no man’s prison door?", 3
"What laws shall you fear if you dance but stumble against no man’s iron chains?", 3
"And who is he that shall bring you to judgment if you tear off your garment yet leave it in no man’s path?", 3
"People of Orphalese, you can muffle the drum, and you can loosen the strings of the lyre, but who shall command the skylark not to sing?", 3
"Even as slaves humble themselves before a tyrant and praise him though he slays them.", 1
"Ay, in the grove of the temple and in the shadow of the citadel I have seen the freest among you wear their freedom as a yoke and a handcuff.", 3
"And my heart bled within me; for you can only be free when even the desire of seeking freedom becomes a harness to you, and when you cease to speak of freedom as a goal and a fulfilment.", 3
"You shall be free indeed when your days are not without a care nor your nights without a want and a grief,", 1
"But rather when these things girdle your life and yet you rise above them naked and unbound.", 3
"And how shall you rise beyond your days and nights unless you break the chains which you at the dawn of your understanding have fastened around your noon hour?", 3
"In truth that which you call freedom is the strongest of these chains, though its links glitter in the sun and dazzle your eyes.", 3
"And what is it but fragments of your own self you would discard that you may become free?", 3
"If it is an unjust law you would abolish, that law was written with your own hand upon your own forehead.", 3
"You cannot erase it by burning your law books nor by washing the foreheads of your judges, though you pour the sea upon them.", 1
"And if it is a despot you would dethrone, see first that his throne erected within you is destroyed.", 1
"For how can a tyrant rule the free and the proud, but for a tyranny in their own freedom and a shame in their own pride?", 3
"And if it is a care you would cast off, that cart has been chosen by you rather than imposed upon you.", 1
"And if it is a fear you would dispel, the seat of that fear is in your heart and not in the hand of the feared.", 3
"Verily all things move within your being in constant half embrace, the desired and the dreaded, the repugnant and the cherished, the pursued and that which you would escape.", 1
"These things move within you as lights and shadows in pairs that cling.", 3
"And when the shadow fades and is no more, the light that lingers becomes a shadow to another light.", 3
"And thus your freedom when it loses its fetters becomes itself the fetter of a greater freedom.", 3
"Your soul is oftentimes a battlefield, upon which your reason and your judgment wage war against your passion and your appetite.", 3
"Would that I could be the peacemaker in your soul, that I might turn the discord and the rivalry of your elements into oneness and melody.", 3
"But how shall I, unless you yourselves be also the peacemakers, nay, the lovers of all your elements?", 1
"Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul.", 3
"If either your sails or your rudder be broken, you can but toss and drift, or else be held at a standstill in mid-seas.", 1
"For reason, ruling alone, is a force confining; and passion, unattended, is a flame that burns to its own destruction.", 3
"Therefore let your soul exalt your reason to the height of passion, that it may sing;", 3
"And let it direct your passion with reason, that your passion may live through its own daily resurrection, and like the phoenix rise above its own ashes.", 3
"I would have you consider your judgment and your appetite even as you would two loved guests in your house.", 3
"Surely you would not honour one guest above the other; for he who is more mindful of one loses the love and the faith of both", 1
"Among the hills, when you sit in the cool shade of the white poplars, sharing the peace and serenity of distant fields and meadows--then let your heart say in silence, “God rests in reason.”", 3
"And since you are a breath in God’s sphere, and a leaf in God’s forest, you too should rest in reason and move in passion.", 3
"Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.", 3
"Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.", 3
"And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy;", 3
"And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields.", 1
"And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief.", 1
"Much of your pain is self-chosen.", 1
"It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.", 3
"Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquillity:", 1
"For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen,", 1
"And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears.", 3
"Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.", 1
"But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart’s knowledge.", 1
"You would know in words that which you have always known in thought.", 1
"You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.", 3
"And it is well you should.", 1
"The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea;", 3
"And the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.", 3
"But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;", 1
"And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.", 1
"For self is a sea boundless and measureless.", 3
"Say not, “I have found the truth,” but rather, “I have found a truth.”", 1
"Say not, “I have found the path of the soul.”", 1
"Say rather, “I have met the soul walking upon my path.”", 1
"For the soul walks upon all paths.", 1
"The soul walks not upon a line, neither does it grow like a reed.", 1
"The soul unfolds itself, like a lotus of countless petals.", 3
"The teacher who walks in the shadow of the temple, among his followers, gives not of his wisdom but rather of his faith and his lovingness.", 1
"If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom, but rather leads you to the threshold of your own mind.", 1
"The astronomer may speak to you of his understanding of space, but he cannot give you his understanding.", 1
"The musician may sing to you of the rhythm which is in all space, but he cannot give you the ear which arrests the rhythm nor the voice that echoes it.", 1
"And he who is versed in the science of numbers can tell of the regions of weight and measure, but he cannot conduct you thither.", 1
"For the vision of one man lends not its wings to another man.", 3
"And even as each one of you stands alone in God’s knowledge, so must each one of you be alone in his knowledge of God and in his understanding of the earth.", 1
"Your friend is your needs answered.", 3
"He is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving.", 3
"And he is your board and your fireside.", 3
"For you come to him with your hunger, and you seek him for peace.", 1
"When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the “nay” in your own mind, nor do you withhold the “ay.”", 1
"And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;", 1
"For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.", 1
"When you part from your friend, you grieve not;", 1
"For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.", 3
"And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.", 1
"For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.", 3
"And let your best be for your friend.", 1
"If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.", 3
"For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?", 3
"Seek him always with hours to live.", 1
"For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.", 1
"And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.", 1
"For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.", 3
"You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts;", 1
"And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime.", 3
"And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered.", 3
"For thought is a bird of space, that in a cage of words may indeed unfold its wings but cannot fly.", 3
"There are those among you who seek the talkative through fear of being alone.", 1
"The silence of aloneness reveals to their eyes their naked selves and they would escape.", 3
"And there are those who talk, and without knowledge or forethought reveal a truth which they themselves do not understand.", 1
"And there are those who have the truth within them, but they tell it not in words.", 1
"In the bosom of such as these the spirit dwells in rhythmic silence.", 3
"When you meet your friend on the roadside or in the market place, let the spirit in you move your lips and direct your tongue.", 1
"Let the voice within your voice speak to the ear of his ear;", 3
"For his soul will keep the truth of your heart as the taste of the wine is remembered", 3
"When the colour is forgotten and the vessel is no more.", 1
"You would measure time the measureless and the immeasurable.", 3
"You would adjust your conduct and even direct the course of your spirit according to hours and seasons.", 1
"Of time you would make a stream upon whose bank you would sit and watch its flowing.", 3
"Yet the timeless in you is aware of life’s timelessness,", 3
"And knows that yesterday is but today’s memory and tomorrow is today’s dream.", 3
"And that that which sings and contemplates in you is still dwelling within the bounds of that first moment which scattered the stars into space.", 3
"Who among you does not feel that his power to love is boundless?", 3
"And yet who does not feel that very love, though boundless, encompassed within the centre of his being, and moving not from love thought to love thought, nor from love deeds to other love deeds?", 3
"And is not time even as love is, undivided and paceless?", 3
"But if in your thought you must measure time into seasons, let each season encircle all the other seasons,", 3
"And let today embrace the past with remembrance and the future with longing.", 3
"Of the good in you I can speak, but not of the evil.", 1
"For what is evil but good tortured by its own hunger and thirst?", 3
"Verily when good is hungry it seeks food even in dark caves, and when it thirsts it drinks even of dead waters.", 3
"You are good when you are one with yourself.", 1
"Yet when you are not one with yourself you are not evil.", 1
"For a divided house is not a den of thieves; it is only a divided house.", 3
"And a ship without rudder may wander aimlessly among perilous isles yet sink not to the bottom.", 3
"You are good when you strive to give of yourself.", 1
"Yet you are not evil when you seek gain for yourself.", 1
"For when you strive for gain you are but a root that clings to the earth and sucks at her breast.", 3
"Surely the fruit cannot say to the root, “Be like me, ripe and full and ever giving of your abundance.”", 3
"For to the fruit giving is a need, as receiving is a need to the root.", 1
"You are good when you are fully awake in your speech,", 1
"Yet you are not evil when you sleep while your tongue staggers without purpose.", 1
"And even stumbling speech may strengthen a weak tongue.", 1
"You are good when you walk to your goal firmly and with bold steps.", 1
"Yet you are not evil when you go thither limping.", 1
"Even those who limp go not backward.", 1
"But you who are strong and swift, see that you do not limp before the lame, deeming it kindness.", 1
"You are good in countless ways, and you are not evil when you are not good,", 1
"You are only loitering and sluggard.", 1
"Pity that the stags cannot teach swiftness to the turtles.", 3
"In your longing for your giant self lies your goodness: and that longing is in all of you.", 1
"But in some of you that longing is a torrent rushing with might to the sea, carrying the secrets of the hillsides and the songs of the forest.", 3
"And in others it is a flat stream that loses itself in angles and bends and lingers before it reaches the shore.", 3
"But let not him who longs much say to him who longs little, “Wherefore are you slow and halting?”", 1
"For the truly good ask not the naked, “Where is your garment?” nor the houseless, “What has befallen your house?”", 1
"You pray in your distress and in your need; would that you might pray also in the fullness of your joy and in your days of abundance.", 1
"For what is prayer but the expansion of yourself into the living ether?", 3
"And if it is for your comfort to pour your darkness into space, it is also for your delight to pour forth the dawning of your heart.", 3
"And if you cannot but weep when your soul summons you to prayer, she should spur you again and yet again, though weeping, until you shall come laughing.", 1
"When you pray you rise to meet in the air those who are praying at that very hour, and whom save in prayer you may not meet.", 1
"Therefore let your visit to that temple invisible be for naught but ecstasy and sweet communion.", 1
"For if you should enter the temple for no other purpose than asking you shall not receive:", 1
"And if you should enter into it to humble yourself you shall not be lifted:", 1
"Or even if you should enter into it to beg for the good of others you shall not be heard.", 1
"It is enough that you enter the temple invisible.", 1
"I cannot teach you how to pray in words.", 1
"God listens not to your words save when He Himself utters them through your lips.", 3
"And I cannot teach you the prayer of the seas and the forests and the mountains.", 1
"But you who are born of the mountains and the forests and the seas can find their prayer in your heart,", 1
"And if you but listen in the stillness of the night you shall hear them saying in silence,", 1
"“Our God, who art our winged self, it is thy will in us that willeth.", 3
"It is thy desire in us that desireth.", 1
"It is thy urge in us that would turn our nights, which are thine, into days which are thine also.", 1
"We cannot ask thee for aught, for thou knowest our needs before they are born in us:", 1
"Thou art our need; and in giving us more of thyself thou givest us all.”", 1
"Pleasure is a freedom-song,", 3
"But it is not freedom.", 1
"It is the blossoming of your desires,", 3
"But it is not their fruit.", 1
"It is a depth calling unto a height,", 3
"But it is not the deep nor the high.", 1
"It is the caged taking wing,", 3
"But it is not space encompassed.", 1
"Ay, in very truth, pleasure is a freedom-song.", 1
"And I fain would have you sing it with fullness of heart; yet I would not have you lose your hearts in the singing.", 1
"Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, and they are judged and rebuked.", 1
"I would not judge nor rebuke them.", 1
"I would have them seek.", 1
"For they shall find pleasure, but not her alone;", 1
"Seven are her sisters, and the least of them is more beautiful than pleasure.", 3
"Have you not heard of the man who was digging in the earth for roots and found a treasure?", 1
"And some of your elders remember pleasures with regret like wrongs committed in drunkenness.", 1
"But regret is the beclouding of the mind and not its chastisement.", 3
"They should remember their pleasures with gratitude, as they would the harvest of a summer.", 3
"Yet if it comforts them to regret, let them be comforted.", 1
"And there are among you those who are neither young to seek nor old to remember;", 1
"And in their fear of seeking and remembering they shun all pleasures, lest they neglect the spirit or offend against it.", 1
"But even in their foregoing is their pleasure.", 1
"And thus they too find a treasure though they dig for roots with quivering hands.", 3
"But tell me, who is he that can offend the spirit?", 3
"Shall the nightingale offend the stillness of the night, or the firefly the stars?", 3
"And shall your flame or your smoke burden the wind?", 3
"Think you the spirit is a still pool which you can trouble with a staff?", 3
"Oftentimes in denying yourself pleasure you do but store the desire in the recesses of your being.", 1
"Who knows but that which seems omitted today, waits for tomorrow?", 3
"Even your body knows its heritage and its rightful need and will not be deceived.", 1
"And your body is the harp of your soul,", 3
"And it is yours to bring forth sweet music from it or confused sounds.", 1
"And now you ask in your heart, “How shall we distinguish that which is good in pleasure from that which is not good?”", 1
"Go to your fields and your gardens, and you shall learn that it is the pleasure of the bee to gather honey of the flower,", 1
"But it is also the pleasure of the flower to yield its honey to the bee.", 1
"For to the bee a flower is a fountain of life,", 3
"And to the flower a bee is a messenger of love,", 3
"And to both, bee and flower, the giving and the receiving of pleasure is a need and an ecstasy.", 1
"People of Orphalese, be in your pleasures like the flowers and the bees.", 3
"Where shall you seek beauty, and how shall you find her unless she herself be your way and your guide?", 3
"And how shall you speak of her except she be the weaver of your speech?", 3
"The aggrieved and the injured say, “Beauty is kind and gentle.", 1
"Like a young mother half-shy of her own glory she walks among us.”", 3
"And the passionate say, “Nay, beauty is a thing of might and dread.", 1
"Like the tempest she shakes the earth beneath us and the sky above us.”", 3
"The tired and the weary say, “Beauty is of soft whisperings.", 1
"Her voice yields to our silences like a faint light that quivers in fear of the shadow.”", 3
"But the restless say, “We have heard her shouting among the mountains,", 1
"And with her cries came the sound of hoofs, and the beating of wings and the roaring of lions.”", 1
"At night the watchmen of the city say, “Beauty shall rise with the dawn from the east.”", 1
"And at noontide the toilers and the wayfarers say, “We have seen her leaning over the earth from the windows of the sunset.”", 1
"In winter say the snow-bound, “She shall come with the spring leaping upon the hills.”", 1
"And in the summer heat the reapers say, “We have seen her dancing with the autumn leaves, and we saw a drift of snow in her hair.”", 1
"All these things have you said of beauty,", 1
"Yet in truth you spoke not of her but of needs unsatisfied,", 1
"And beauty is not a need but an ecstasy.", 1
"It is not a mouth thirsting nor an empty hand stretched forth,", 1
"But rather a heart enflamed and a soul enchanted.", 3
"It is not the image you would see nor the song you would hear,", 1
"But rather an image you see though you close your eyes and a song you hear though you shut your ears.", 3
"It is not the sap within the furrowed bark, nor a wing attached to a claw,", 3
"But rather a garden for ever in bloom and a flock of angels for ever in flight.", 3
"People of Orphalese, beauty is life when life unveils her holy face.", 3
"But you are life and you are the veil.", 3
"Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror.", 3
"But you are eternity and you are the mirror.", 3
"Have I spoken this day of aught else?", 3
"Is not religion all deeds and all reflection,", 1
"And that which is neither deed nor reflection, but a wonder and a surprise ever springing in the soul, even while the hands hew the stone or tend the loom?", 3
"Who can separate his faith from his actions, or his belief from his occupations?", 3
"Who can spread his hours before him, saying, “This for God and this for myself; This for my soul, and this other for my body?”", 3
"All your hours are wings that beat through space from self to self.", 3
"He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked.", 3
"The wind and the sun will tear no holes in his skin.", 1
"And he who defines his conduct by ethics imprisons his song-bird in a cage.", 3
"The freest song comes not through bars and wires.", 1
"And he to whom worshipping is a window, to open but also to shut, has not yet visited the house of his soul whose windows are from dawn to dawn.", 3
"Your daily life is your temple and your religion.", 3
"Whenever you enter into it take with you your all.", 1
"Take the plough and the forge and the mallet and the lute,", 1
"The things you have fashioned in necessity or for delight.", 1
"For in revery you cannot rise above your achievements nor fall lower than your failures.", 1
"And take with you all men:", 1
"For in adoration you cannot fly higher than their hopes nor humble yourself lower than their despair.", 1
"And if you would know God be not therefore a solver of riddles.", 1
"Rather look about you and you shall see Him playing with your children.", 1
"And look into space; you shall see Him walking in the cloud, outstretching His arms in the lightning and descending in rain.", 1
"You shall see Him smiling in flowers, then rising and waving His hands in trees.", 1
"You would know the secret of death.", 1
"But how shall you find it unless you seek it in the heart of life?", 3
"The owl whose night-bound eyes are blind unto the day cannot unveil the mystery of light.", 3
"If you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life.", 1
"For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one.", 3
"In the depth of your hopes and desires lies your silent knowledge of the beyond;", 1
"And like seeds dreaming beneath the snow your heart dreams of spring.", 3
"Trust the dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity.", 3
"Your fear of death is but the trembling of the shepherd when he stands before the king whose hand is to be laid upon him in honour.", 3
"Is the shepherd not joyful beneath his trembling, that he shall wear the mark of the king?", 3
"Yet is he not more mindful of his trembling?", 1
"For what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and to melt into the sun?", 3
"And what is it to cease breathing, but to free the breath from its restless tides, that it may rise and expand and seek God unencumbered?", 3
"Only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing.", 3
"And when you have reached the mountain top, then you shall begin to climb.", 3
"And when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance.", 3
"And now it was evening.", 1
"And Almitra the seeress said, Blessed be this day and this place and your spirit that has spoken.", 1
"And he answered, Was it I who spoke?", 3
"Was I not also a listener?", 3
"Then he descended the steps of the Temple and all the people followed him.", 1
"And he reached his ship and stood upon the deck.", 1
"And facing the people again, he raised his voice and said:", 1
"People of Orphalese, the wind bids me leave you.", 1
"Less hasty am I than the wind, yet I must go.", 3
"We wanderers, ever seeking the lonelier way, begin no day where we have ended another day; and no sunrise finds us where sunset left us.", 1
"Even while the earth sleeps we travel.", 3
"We are the seeds of the tenacious plant, and it is in our ripeness and our fullness of heart that we are given to the wind and are scattered.", 3
"Brief were my days among you, and briefer still the words I have spoken.", 1
"But should my voice fade in your ears, and my love vanish in your memory, then I will come again,", 1
"And with a richer heart and lips more yielding to the spirit will I speak.", 1
"Yea, I shall return with the tide,", 1
"And though death may hide me, and the greater silence enfold me, yet again will I seek your understanding.", 1
"And not in vain will I seek.", 1
"If aught I have said is truth, that truth shall reveal itself in a clearer voice, and in words more kin to your thoughts.", 1
"I go with the wind, people of Orphalese, but not down into emptiness;", 1
"And if this day is not a fulfilment of your needs and my love, then let it be a promise till another day.", 1
"Man’s needs change, but not his love, nor his desire that his love should satisfy his needs.", 1
"Know therefore, that from the greater silence I shall return.", 1
"The mist that drifts away at dawn, leaving but dew in the fields, shall rise and gather into a cloud and then fall down in rain.", 3
"And not unlike the mist have I been.", 3
"In the stillness of the night I have walked in your streets, and my spirit has entered your houses,", 1
"And your heart-beats were in my heart, and your breath was upon my face, and I knew you all.", 1
"Ay, I knew your joy and your pain, and in your sleep your dreams were my dreams.", 1
"And oftentimes I was among you a lake among the mountains.", 3
"I mirrored the summits in you and the bending slopes, and even the passing flocks of your thoughts and your desires.", 3
"And to my silence came the laughter of your children in streams, and the longing of your youths in rivers.", 3
"And when they reached my depth the streams and the rivers ceased not yet to sing.", 1
"But sweeter still than laughter and greater than longing came to me.", 1
"It was the boundless in you;", 1
"The vast man in whom you are all but cells and sinews;", 3
"He in whose chant all your singing is but a soundless throbbing.", 3
"It is in the vast man that you are vast,", 1
"And in beholding him that I beheld you and loved you.", 1
"For what distances can love reach that are not in that vast sphere?", 3
"What visions, what expectations and what presumptions can outsoar that flight?", 3
"Like a giant oak tree covered with apple blossoms is the vast man in you.", 3
"His might binds you to the earth, his fragrance lifts you into space, and in his durability you are deathless.", 1
"You have been told that, even like a chain, you are as weak as your weakest link.", 1
"This is but half the truth.", 1
"You are also as strong as your strongest link.", 1
"To measure you by your smallest deed is to reckon the power of ocean by the frailty of its foam.", 3
"To judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their inconstancy.", 3
"Ay, you are like an ocean,", 3
"And though heavy-grounded ships await the tide upon your shores, yet, even like an ocean, you cannot hasten your tides.", 3
"And like the seasons you are also,", 3
"And though in your winter you deny your spring,", 1
"Yet spring, reposing within you, smiles in her drowsiness and is not offended.", 3
"I only speak to you in words of that which you yourselves know in thought.", 1
"And what is word knowledge but a shadow of wordless knowledge?", 3
"Your thoughts and my words are waves from a sealed memory that keeps records of our yesterdays,", 3
"And of the ancient days when the earth knew not us nor herself,", 1
"And of nights when earth was up-wrought with confusion.", 1
"Wise men have come to you to give you of their wisdom.", 1
"I came to take of your wisdom:", 1
"And behold I have found that which is greater than wisdom.", 1
"It is a flame spirit in you ever gathering more of itself,", 3
"While you, heedless of its expansion, bewail the withering of your days.", 1
"It is life in quest of life in bodies that fear the grave.", 3
"There are no graves here.", 1
"These mountains and plains are a cradle and a stepping-stone.", 3
"Whenever you pass by the field where you have laid your ancestors look well thereupon, and you shall see yourselves and your children dancing hand in hand.", 1
"Verily you often make merry without knowing.", 3
"Less than a promise have I given, and yet more generous have you been to me.", 1
"You have given me my deeper thirsting after life.", 1
"Surely there is no greater gift to a man than that which turns all his aims into parching lips and all life into a fountain.", 3
"And in this lies my honour and my reward,--", 1
"That whenever I come to the fountain to drink I find the living water itself thirsty;", 3
"And it drinks me while I drink it.", 3
"Some of you have deemed me proud and over-shy to receive gifts.", 1
"Too proud indeed am I to receive wages, but not gifts.", 1
"And though I have eaten berries among the hills when you would have had me sit at your board,", 1
"And slept in the portico of the temple when you would gladly have sheltered me,", 1
"Yet was it not your loving mindfulness of my days and my nights that made food sweet to my mouth and girdled my sleep with visions?", 3
"For this I bless you most:", 1
"You give much and know not that you give at all.", 1
"Verily the kindness that gazes upon itself in a mirror turns to stone,", 3
"And a good deed that calls itself by tender names becomes the parent to a curse.", 3
"And some of you have called me aloof, and drunk with my own aloneness,", 1
"He sits alone on hill-tops and looks down upon our city.”", 1
"True it is that I have climbed the hills and walked in remote places.", 1
"How could I have seen you save from a great height or a great distance?", 3
"How can one be indeed near unless he be far?", 3
"And others among you called unto me, not in words, and they said,", 1
"Why seek you the unattainable?", 3
"What storms would you trap in your net,", 3
"And what vaporous birds do you hunt in the sky?", 3
"Come and be one of us.", 1
"Descend and appease your hunger with our bread and quench your thirst with our wine.”", 1
"In the solitude of their souls they said these things;", 1
"But were their solitude deeper they would have known that I sought but the secret of your joy and your pain,", 1
"And I hunted only your larger selves that walk the sky.", 3
"But the hunter was also the hunted;", 3
"For many of my arrows left my bow only to seek my own breast.", 3
"And the flier was also the creeper;", 3
"For when my wings were spread in the sun their shadow upon the earth was a turtle.", 3
"And I the believer was also the doubter;", 3
"For often have I put my finger in my own wound that I might have the greater belief in you and the greater knowledge of you.", 1
"And it is with this belief and this knowledge that I say,", 1
"You are not enclosed within your bodies, nor confined to houses or fields.", 1
"That which is you dwells above the mountain and roves with the wind.", 3
"It is not a thing that crawls into the sun for warmth or digs holes into darkness for safety,", 3
"But a thing free, a spirit that envelops the earth and moves in the ether.", 3
"If these be vague words, then seek not to clear them.", 1
"Vague and nebulous is the beginning of all things, but not their end,", 1
"And I fain would have you remember me as a beginning.", 1
"Life, and all that lives, is conceived in the mist and not in the crystal.", 3
"And who knows but a crystal is mist in decay?", 3
"This would I have you remember in remembering me:", 1
"That which seems most feeble and bewildered in you is the strongest and most determined.", 1
"Is it not your breath that has erected and hardened the structure of your bones?", 3
"And is it not a dream which none of you remember having dreamt, that builded your city and fashioned all there is in it?", 3
"Could you but see the tides of that breath you would cease to see all else,", 3
"And if you could hear the whispering of the dream you would hear no other sound.", 3
"But you do not see, nor do you hear, and it is well.", 1
"The veil that clouds your eyes shall be lifted by the hands that wove it,", 3
"And the clay that fills your ears shall be pierced by those fingers that kneaded it.", 3
"And you shall see.", 1
"And you shall hear.", 1
"Yet you shall not deplore having known blindness, nor regret having been deaf.", 1
"For in that day you shall know the hidden purposes in all things,", 1
"And you shall bless darkness as you would bless light.", 3
"After saying these things he looked about him, and he saw the pilot of his ship standing by the helm and gazing now at the full sails and now at the distance.", 1
"And he said:", 1
"Patient, over patient, is the captain of my ship.", 1
"The wind blows, and restless are the sails;", 1
"Even the rudder begs direction;", 1
"Yet quietly my captain awaits my silence.", 1
"And these my mariners, who have heard the choir of the greater sea, they too have heard me patiently.", 1
"Now they shall wait no longer.", 1
"I am ready.", 1
"The stream has reached the sea, and once more the great mother holds her son against her breast.", 3
"Fare you well, people of Orphalese.", 1
"This day has ended.", 1
"It is closing upon us even as the water-lily upon its own tomorrow.", 3
"What was given us here we shall keep,", 1
"And if it suffices not, then again must we come together and together stretch our hands unto the giver.", 1
"Forget not that I shall come back to you.", 1
"A little while, and my longing shall gather dust and foam for another body.", 3
"A little while, a moment of rest upon the wind, and another woman shall bear me.", 3
"Farewell to you and the youth I have spent with you.", 1
"It was but yesterday we met in a dream.", 3
"You have sung to me in my aloneness, and I of your longings have built a tower in the sky.", 3
"But now our sleep has fled and our dream is over, and it is no longer dawn.", 1
"The noontide is upon us and our half waking has turned to fuller day, and we must part.", 1
"If in the twilight of memory we should meet once more, we shall speak again together and you shall sing to me a deeper song.", 1
"And if our hands should meet in another dream we shall build another tower in the sky.", 3
"So saying he made a signal to the seamen, and straightway they weighed anchor and cast the ship loose from its moorings, and they moved eastward.", 1
"And a cry came from the people as from a single heart, and it rose into the dusk and was carried out over the sea like a great trumpeting.", 3
"Only Almitra was silent, gazing after the ship until it had vanished into the mist.", 1
"And when all the people were dispersed she still stood alone upon the sea-wall, remembering in her heart his saying,", 1 
"His real name was M. Annius Verus, and he was sprung of a noble family which claimed descent from Numa, second King of Rome.", 1
"Thus the most religious of emperors came of the blood of the most pious of early kings.", 3
"His father, Annius Verus, had held high office in Rome, and his grandfather, of the same name, had been thrice Consul.", 1
"Both his parents died young, but Marcus held them in loving remembrance.", 1
"On his father's death Marcus was adopted by his grandfather, the consular Annius Verus, and there was deep love between these two.", 1
"The Emperor Hadrian divined the fine character of the lad, whom he used to call not Verus but Verissimus, more Truthful than his own name.", 1
"He advanced Marcus to equestrian rank when six years of age, and at the age of eight made him a member of the ancient Salian priesthood.", 1
"The boy's aunt, Annia Galeria Faustina, was married to Antoninus Pius, afterwards emperor.", 1
"The ablest teachers were engaged for him, and he was trained in the strict doctrine of the Stoic philosophy, which was his great delight.", 1
"He was taught to dress plainly and to live simply, to avoid all softness and luxury.", 1
"At the same time he was kept from the extravagancies of his day.", 1
"The great excitement in Rome was the strife of the Factions, as they were called, in the circus.", 1
"Riot and corruption went in the train of the racing chariots; and from all these things Marcus held severely aloof.", 1
"In 140 Marcus was raised to the consulship, and in 145 his betrothal was consummated by marriage.", 1
"Two years later Faustina brought him a daughter; and soon after the tribunate and other imperial honours were conferred upon him.", 1
"Antoninus Pius died in 161, and Marcus assumed the imperial state.", 1
"Henceforth the two are colleagues in the empire, the junior being trained as it were to succeed.", 1
"No sooner was Marcus settled upon the throne than wars broke out on all sides.", 1
"Verus was sent off in hot haste to quell this rising; and he fulfilled his trust by plunging into drunkenness and debauchery, while the war was left to his officers.", 3
"Soon after Marcus had to face a more serious danger at home in the coalition of several powerful tribes on the northern frontier.", 1
"Chief among those were the Marcomanni or Marchmen, the Quadi (mentioned in this book), the Sarmatians, the Catti, the Jazyges.", 1
"Marcus was himself commander-in-chief, and victory was due no less to his own ability than to his wisdom in choice of lieutenants, shown conspicuously in the case of Pertinax.", 1
"There were several important battles fought in these campaigns; and one of them has become celebrated for the legend of the Thundering Legion.", 1
"The settlement made after these troubles might have been more satisfactory but for an unexpected rising in the east.", 3
"Avidius Cassius, an able captain who had won renown in the Parthian wars, was at this time chief governor of the eastern provinces.", 1
"Marcus, on hearing the news, immediately patched up a peace and returned home to meet this new peril.", 1
"The emperors great grief was that he must needs engage in the horrors of civil strife.", 1
"The good emperor was not spared domestic troubles.", 3
"Faustina had borne him several children, of whom he was passionately fond.", 1
"Their innocent faces may still be seen in many a sculpture gallery, recalling with odd effect the dreamy countenance of their father.", 3
"But they died one by one, and when Marcus came to his own end only one of his sons still lived--the weak and worthless Commodus.", 1
"As a soldier we have seen that Marcus was both capable and successful; as an administrator he was prudent and conscientious.", 3
"Although steeped in the teachings of philosophy, he did not attempt to remodel the world on any preconceived plan.", 1
"He trod the path beaten by his predecessors, seeking only to do his duty as well as he could, and to keep out corruption.", 3
"He did some unwise things, it is true.", 3
"He erred in his civil administration by too much centralising.", 1
"But the strong point of his reign was the administration of justice.", 1
"Marcus sought by-laws to protect the weak, to make the lot of the slaves less hard, to stand in place of father to the fatherless.", 1
"Charitable foundations were endowed for rearing and educating poor children.", 1
"The provinces were protected against oppression, and public help was given to cities or districts which might be visited by calamity.", 1
"The great blot on his name, and one hard indeed to explain, is his treatment of the Christians.", 1
"In this respect Trajan was better than he.", 3
"To a thoughtful mind such a religion as that of Rome would give small satisfaction.", 3
"Its legends were often childish or impossible; its teaching had little to do with morality.", 3
"In this case all devout souls were thrown back upon philosophy, as they had been, though to a less extent, in Greece.", 3
"There were under the early empire two rival schools which practically divided the field between them, Stoicism and Epicureanism.", 1
"The ideal set before each was nominally much the same.", 1
"With Epicureanism we have nothing to do now; but it will be worth while to sketch the history and tenets of the Stoic sect.", 1
"He studied under the cynic Crates, but he did not neglect other philosophical systems.", 1
"After many years' study he opened his own school in a colonnade in Athens called the Painted Porch, or Stoa, which gave the Stoics their name.", 1
"Next to Zeno, the School of the Porch owes most to Chrysippus (280--207 b.c.), who organised Stoicism into a system.", 1
"Of him it was said, 'But for Chrysippus, there had been no Porch.'", 1
"This conforming of the life to nature was the Stoic idea of Virtue.", 1
"This dictum might easily be taken to mean that virtue consists in yielding to each natural impulse; but that was very far from the Stoic meaning.", 1
"The Stoic system of physics was materialism with an infusion of pantheism.", 1
"The universe, then, is God, of whom the popular gods are manifestations; while legends and myths are allegorical.", 1
"The soul of man is thus an emanation from the godhead, into whom it will eventually be re-absorbed.", 1
"The divine ruling principle makes all things work together for good, but for the good of the whole.", 1
"In the individual it is virtue alone which enables him to do this; as Providence rules the universe, so virtue in the soul must rule man.", 1
"In Logic, the Stoic system is noteworthy for their theory as to the test of truth, the Criterion.", 1
"They compared the new-born soul to a sheet of paper ready for writing.", 1
"Ideas and inferences artificially produced by deduction or the like were tested by this 'holding perception.'", 1
"Of the Ethical application I have already spoken.", 1
"The highest good was the virtuous life.", 1
"Virtue alone is happiness, and vice is unhappiness.", 1
"Moreover, nothing is good but virtue, and nothing but vice is bad.", 1
"All these things are merely the sphere in which virtue may act.", 1
"These were neither virtuous nor vicious, but, like the indifferent things, held a middle place.", 1
"Two points in the Stoic system deserve special mention.", 1
"One is a careful distinction between things which are in our power and things which are not.", 1
"Desire and dislike, opinion and affection, are within the power of the will; whereas health, wealth, honour, and other such are generally not so.", 1
"This is a special application of the favourite Greek virtue of moderation, (σωφροσύνη) and has also its parallel in Christian ethics.", 1
"The second point is a strong insistence on the unity of the universe, and on man's duty as part of a great whole.", 1
"Public spirit was the most splendid political virtue of the ancient world, and it is here made cosmopolitan.", 3
"It is again instructive to note that Christian sages insisted on the same thing.", 1
"Such is the system which underlies the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius.", 1
"Some knowledge of it is necessary to the right understanding of the book, but for us the chief interest lies elsewhere.", 1
"We do not come to Marcus Aurelius for a treatise on Stoicism.", 1
"He is no head of a school to lay down a body of doctrine for students; he does not even contemplate that others should read what he writes.", 1
"His philosophy is not an eager intellectual inquiry, but more what we should call religious feeling.", 3
"His book records the innermost thoughts of his heart, set down to ease it, with such moral maxims and reflections as may help him to bear the burden of duty...", 1
"It is instructive to compare the Meditations with another famous book, the Imitation of Christ.", 1
"There is the same ideal of self-control in both.", 1
"'In withstanding of the passions standeth very peace of heart.'", 1
"'Let us set the axe to the root, that we being purged of our passions may have a peaceable mind.'", 1
"To this end there must be continual self-examination.", 1
"The Roman scrutinises his faults with severity, but without the self-contempt which makes the Christian 'vile in his own sight.'", 1
"Both rate men's praise or blame at their real worthlessness; 'Let not thy peace,' says the Christian, 'be in the mouths of men.'", 1
"But it is to God's censure the Christian appeals, the Roman to his own soul.", 1
"The petty annoyances of injustice or unkindness are looked on by each with the same magnanimity.", 1
"'Why doth a little thing said or done against thee make thee sorry?", 1
"It is no new thing; it is not the first, nor shall it be the last, if thou live long.", 1
"At best suffer patiently, if thou canst not suffer joyously.'", 1
"The Christian should sorrow more for other men's malice than for our own wrongs; but the Roman is inclined to wash his hands of the offender.", 1
"The virtue of suffering in itself is an idea which does not meet us in the Meditations.", 1
"Both alike realise that man is one of a great community.", 1
"To the saint as to the emperor, the world is a poor thing at best.", 3
"But there is one great difference between the two books we are considering.", 1
"The Imitation is addressed to others, the Meditations by the writer to himself.", 1
"In their intimacy and frankness lies their great charm.", 3
"These notes are not sermons; they are not even confessions.", 1
"There is always an air of self-consciousness in confessions; in such revelations there is always a danger of unctuousness or of vulgarity for the best of men.", 3
"St. Augus-tine is not always clear of offence, and John Bunyan himself exaggerates venial peccadilloes into heinous sins.", 1
"But Marcus Aurelius is neither vulgar nor unctuous; he extenuates nothing, but nothing sets down in malice.", 3
"He never poses before an audience; he may not be profound, he is always sincere.", 3
"And it is a lofty and serene soul which is here disclosed before us.", 3
"Vulgar vices seem to have no temptation for him; this is not one tied and bound with chains which he strives to break.", 3
"The faults he detects in himself are often such as most men would have no eyes to see.", 3
"Unwavering courtesy and consideration are his aims.", 1
"'Whatsoever any man either doth or saith, thou must be good;' 'doth any man offend?", 1
"It is against himself that he doth offend: why should it trouble thee?'", 1
"The offender needs pity, not wrath; those who must needs be corrected, should be treated with tact and gentleness; and one must be always ready to learn better.", 1
"'The best kind of revenge is, not to become like unto them.'", 1
"There are so many hints of offence forgiven, that we may believe the notes followed sharp on the facts.", 3
"Perhaps he has fallen short of his aim, and thus seeks to call his principles to mind, and to strengthen himself for the future.", 3
"That these sayings are not mere talk is plain from the story of Avidius Cassius, who would have usurped his imperial throne.", 1
"Thus the emperor faithfully carries out his own principle, that evil must be overcome with good.", 1
"One so gentle towards a foe was sure to be a good friend; and indeed his pages are full of generous gratitude to those who had served him.", 3
"In his First Book he sets down to account all the debts due to his kinsfolk and teachers.", 1
"To his grandfather he owed his own gentle spirit, to his father shamefastness and courage; he learnt of his mother to be religious and bountiful and single-minded.", 1
"Rusticus did not work in vain, if he showed his pupil that his life needed amending.", 1
"Apollonius taught him simplicity, reasonableness, gratitude, a love of true liberty.", 1
"If his was that honest and true heart which is the Christian ideal, this is the more wonderful in that he lacked the faith which makes Christians strong.", 3
"Or again, 'We must needs grant that there is a nature that doth govern the universe.'", 1
"For the rest, the world and its fame and wealth, 'all is vanity.'", 1
"The gods may perhaps have a particular care for him, but their especial care is for the universe at large: thus much should suffice.", 1
"His gods are better than the Stoic gods, who sit aloof from all human things, untroubled and uncaring, but his personal hope is hardly stronger.", 3
"Then he gropes blindly after something less empty and vain.", 3
"There is more in this than the assumption of a rival theory for argument's sake.", 3
"If worldly things 'be but as a dream, the thought is not far off that there may be an awakening to what is real.", 3
"Nature's marvellous power of recreating out of Corruption is surely not confined to bodily things.", 3
"To him they are only sectaries 'violently and passionately set upon opposition.", 1
"Profound as philosophy these Meditations certainly are not; but Marcus Aurelius was too sincere not to see the essence of such things as came within his experience.", 3
"Ancient religions were for the most part concerned with outward things.", 1
"Do the necessary rites, and you propitiate the gods; and these rites were often trivial, sometimes violated right feeling or even morality.", 1
"Even when the gods stood on the side of righteousness, they were concerned with the act more than with the intent.", 1
"But Marcus Aurelius knows that what the heart is full of, the man will do.", 1
"And every page of the book shows us that he knew thought was sure to issue in act.", 1
"He drills his soul, as it were, in right principles, that when the time comes, it may be guided by them.", 3
"To wait until the emergency is to be too late.", 1
"He sees also the true essence of happiness.", 1
"By the irony of fate this man, so gentle and good, so desirous of quiet joys and a mind free from care, was set at the head of the Roman Empire...", 3
"For several years he himself commanded his armies in chief.", 1
"In camp before the Quadi he dates the first book of his Meditations, and shows how he could retire within himself amid the coarse clangour of arms.", 1
"And he did his work well.", 3
"His wars were slow and tedious, but successful.", 1
"With a statesman's wisdom he foresaw the danger to Rome of the barbarian hordes from the north, and took measures to meet it.", 3
"But death cut short his designs.", 1
"Truly a rare opportunity was given to Marcus Aurelius of showing what the mind can do in despite of circumstances.", 3
"His life was one paradox.", 3
"That nothing might lack, it was in camp before the face of the enemy that he passed away and went to his own place.", 3
"Pater’s “Marius the Epicurean” forms another outside commentary, which is of service in the imaginative attempt to create again the period.", 1
"See therefore, that thou have them always in a readiness.", 1
"Of my grandfather Verus I have learned to be gentle and meek, and to refrain from all anger and passion.", 1
"From the fame and memory of him that begot me I have learned both shamefastness and manlike behaviour.", 1
"Not to keep quails for the game; nor to be mad after such things.", 1
"Not to be offended with other men's liberty of speech, and to apply myself unto philosophy.", 1
"And that I gave over the study of rhetoric and poetry, and of elegant neat language.", 1
"That I did not use to walk about the house in my long robe, nor to do any such things.", 1
"Whatsoever he said, all men believed him that as he spake, so he thought, and whatsoever he did, that he did it with a good intent.", 1
"He would also be very pleasant and gracious.", 1
"In my father, I observed his meekness; his constancy without wavering in those things, which after a due examination and deliberation, he had determined.", 1
"His accurate examination of things in consultations, and patient hearing of others.", 1
"His contented mind in all things, his cheerful countenance, his care to foresee things afar off, and to take order for the least, without any noise or clamour.", 1
"...but contrariwise, all things distinctly, as at leisure; without trouble; orderly, soundly, and agreeably.", 1
"From the gods I received that I had good grandfathers, and parents, a good sister, good masters, good domestics, loving kinsmen, almost all that I have;...", 1
"That I was not long brought up by the concubine of my father; that I preserved the flower of my youth.", 1
"That I took not upon me to be a man before my time, but rather put it off longer than I needed.", 1
"That I have had such a brother, who by his own example might stir me up to think of myself; and by his respect and love, delight and please me.", 1
"That I have got ingenuous children, and that they were not born distorted, nor with any other natural deformity.", 1
"That I ever knew Apollonius and Rusticus, and Maximus.", 1
"That I never had to do with Benedicta and Theodotus, yea and afterwards when I fell into some fits of love, I was soon cured.", 1
"That being so that my mother was to die young, yet she lived with me all her latter years.", 1
"That I have such a wife, so obedient, so loving, so ingenuous.", 1
"That I had choice of fit and able men, to whom I might commit the bringing up of my children.", 1
"All these things without the assistance of the gods, and fortune, could not have been.", 1
"All these ill qualities have happened unto them, through ignorance of that which is truly good and truly bad.", 1
"...or angry, and ill affected towards him, who by nature is so near unto me?", 1
"Away with thy books, suffer not thy mind any more to be distracted, and carried to and fro; for it will not be;...", 1
"And as for thy life, consider what it is; a wind; not one constant wind neither, but every moment of an hour let out, and sucked in again.", 1
"Whatsoever proceeds from the gods immediately, that any man will grant totally depends from their divine providence.", 1
"Let these things suffice thee; let them be always unto thee, as thy general rules and precepts.", 1
"It is high time for thee to understand the true nature both of the world, whereof thou art a part;...", 1
"Let it be thy earnest and incessant care as a Roman and a man to perform whatsoever it is that thou art about, with true and unfeigned gravity, natural affection, freedom and justice:...", 1
"Every man's happiness depends from himself, but behold thy life is almost at an end, whiles affording thyself no respect, thou dost make thy happiness to consist in the souls, and conceits of other men.", 3
"Give thyself leisure to learn some good thing, and cease roving and wandering to and fro.", 1
"These things thou must always have in mind: What is the nature of the universe, and what is mine--in particular:", 1
"For he that is angry seems with a kind of grief and close contraction of himself, to turn away from reason;...", 1
"...but he that sins through lust, being overcome by pleasure, doth in his very sin bewray a more impotent, and unmanlike disposition.", 1
"Well then and like a philosopher doth he say, that he of the two is the more to be condemned, that sins with pleasure, than he that sins with grief.", 3
"And as for death, if there be any gods, it is no grievous thing to leave the society of men.", 1
"The gods will do thee no hurt, thou mayest be sure.", 1
"But if it be so that there be no gods, or that they take no care of the world, why should I desire to live in a world void of gods, and of all divine providence?", 3
"But gods there be certainly, and they take care for the world;...", 1
"Consider how quickly all things are dissolved and resolved: the bodies and substances themselves, into the matter and substance of the world: and their memories into the general age and time of the world.", 1
"It is the part of a man endowed with a good understanding faculty, to consider what they themselves are in very deed, from whose bare conceits and voices, honour and credit do proceed:...", 1
"...as also what it is to die, and how if a man shall consider this by itself alone, to die, and separate from it in his mind all those things which with it usually represent themselves unto us, he can conceive of it no otherwise, than as of a work of nature,...", 1
"Now death, it is not only a work of nature, but also conducing to nature.", 1
"Consider with thyself how man, and by what part of his, is joined unto God, and how that part of man is affected, when it is said to be diffused.", 1
"His service doth consist in this, that a man keep himself pure from all violent passion and evil affection, from all rashness and vanity, and from all manner of discontent, either in regard of the gods or men.", 1
"For indeed whatsoever proceeds from the gods, deserves respect for their worth and excellency;...", 1
"Yet remember this, that man can part with no life properly, save with that little part of life, which he now lives:...", 1
"...and that which he lives, is no other, than that which at every instant he parts with.", 1
"For although in regard of that which is already past there may be some inequality, yet that time which is now present and in being, is equal unto all men.", 1
"And that being it which we part with whensoever we die, it doth manifestly appear, that it can be but a moment of time, that we then part with.", 1
"For as for that which is either past or to come, a man cannot be said properly to part with it.", 1
"For how should a man part with that which he hath not?", 1
"These two things therefore thou must remember.", 1
"Remember that all is but opinion and conceit, for those things are plain and apparent, which were spoken unto Monimus the Cynic;...", 1
"Secondly, when she either is averse from any man, or led by contrary desires or affections, tending to his hurt and prejudice; such as are the souls of them that are angry.", 1
"Thirdly, when she is overcome by any pleasure or pain.", 1
"Fourthly, when she doth dissemble, and covertly and falsely either doth or saith anything.", 1
"The time of a man's life is as a point; the substance of it ever flowing, the sense obscure; and the whole composition of the body tending to corruption.", 1
"His soul is restless, fortune uncertain, and fame doubtful;...", 1
"Our life is a warfare, and a mere pilgrimage.", 3
"Fame after life is no better than oblivion.", 3
"What is it then that will adhere and follow?", 1
"Only one thing, philosophy.", 1
"And philosophy doth consist in this, for a man to preserve that spirit which is within him, from all manner of contumelies and injuries, and above all pains or pleasures;...", 1
"...never to do anything either rashly, or feignedly, or hypocritically: wholly to depend from himself and his own proper actions:...", 1
"...all things that happen unto him to embrace contentedly, as coming from Him from whom he himself also came;...", 1
"Is not this according to nature?", 1
"But nothing that is according to nature can be evil.", 1
"This also thou must observe, that whatsoever it is that naturally doth happen to things natural, hath somewhat in itself that is pleasing and delightful:...", 1
"So figs are accounted fairest and ripest then, when they begin to shrink, and wither as it were.", 1
"So ripe olives, when they are next to putrefaction, then are they in their proper beauty.", 1
"Hippocrates having cured many sicknesses, fell sick himself and died.", 1
"Lice killed Democritus; and Socrates, another sort of vermin, wicked ungodly men.", 3
"How then stands the case?", 1
"Thou hast taken ship, thou hast sailed, thou art come to land, go out, if to another life, there also shalt thou find gods, who are everywhere.", 1
"If all life and sense shall cease, then shalt thou cease also to be subject to either pains or pleasures; and to serve and tend this vile cottage;...", 1
"Spend not the remnant of thy days in thoughts and fancies concerning other men, when it is not in relation to some common good, when by it thou art hindered from some other better work.", 1
"He that is such, is he surely that doth not put off to lay hold on that which is best indeed, a very priest and minister of the gods,...", 3
"...deeply dyed and drenched in righteousness, embracing and accepting with his whole heart whatsoever either happeneth or is allotted unto him.", 1
"Do nothing against thy will, nor contrary to the community, nor without due examination, nor with reluctancy.", 1
"Affect not to set out thy thoughts with curious neat language.", 1
"Be neither a great talker, nor a great undertaker.", 1
"To be cheerful, and to stand in no need, either of other men's help or attendance, or of that rest and tranquillity, which thou must be beholding to others for.", 1
"Rather like one that is straight of himself, or hath ever been straight, than one that hath been rectified.", 3
"But if nothing thou shalt find worthy to be preferred to that spirit which is within thee;...", 1
"...if nothing better than to withdraw thyself (to use Socrates his words) from all sensuality, and submit thyself unto the gods, and to have care of all men in general:...", 1
"...if thou shalt find that all other things in comparison of this, are but vile, and of little moment; then give not way to any other thing,...", 1
"For it is not lawful, that anything that is of another and inferior kind and nature, be it what it will, as either popular applause, or honour, or riches, or pleasures; should be suffered to confront and contest as it were, with that which is rational, and operatively good.", 1
"For all these things, if once though but for a while, they begin to please, they presently prevail, and pervert a man's mind, or turn a man from the right way.", 1
"Do thou therefore I say absolutely and freely make choice of that which is best, and stick unto it.", 1
"Now, that they say is best, which is most profitable.", 1
"Never esteem of anything as profitable, which shall ever constrain thee either to break thy faith, or to lose thy modesty; to hate any man, to suspect, to curse, to dissemble, to lust after anything, that requireth the secret of walls or veils.", 1
"But he that preferreth before all things his rational part and spirit, and the sacred mysteries of virtue which issueth from it, he shall never lament and exclaim, never sigh; he shall never want either solitude or company:...", 1
"...and which is chiefest of all, he shall live without either desire or fear.", 1
"And as for life, whether for a long or short time he shall enjoy his soul thus compassed about with a body, he is altogether indifferent.", 1
"For if even now he were to depart, he is as ready for it, as for any other action, which may be performed with modesty and decency.", 1
"For all his life long, this is his only care, that his mind may always be occupied in such intentions and objects, as are proper to a rational sociable creature.", 1
"In the mind that is once truly disciplined and purged, thou canst not find anything, either foul or impure, or as it were festered:...", 1
"The life of such a one, death can never surprise as imperfect; as of an actor, that should die before he had ended, or the play itself were at an end, a man might speak.", 3
"Use thine opinative faculty with all honour and respect, for in her indeed is all:...", 1
"Casting therefore all other things aside, keep thyself to these few, and remember withal that no man properly can be said to live more than that which is now present, which is but a moment of time.", 1
"Whatsoever is besides either is already past, or uncertain.", 1
"The time therefore that any man doth live, is but a little, and the place where he liveth, is but a very little corner of the earth,...", 1
"...and the greatest fame that can remain of a man after his death, even that is but little, and that too, such as it is whilst it is, is by the succession of silly mortal men preserved, who likewise shall shortly die,...", 1
"Of everything therefore thou must use thyself to say, This immediately comes from God, this by that fatal connection, and concatenation of things, or (which almost comes to one) by some coincidental casualty.", 1
"As for those things that of themselves are altogether indifferent, as in my best judgment I conceive everything to deserve more or less, so I carry myself towards it.", 1
"If thou shalt intend that which is present, following the rule of right and reason carefully, solidly, meekly, and shalt not intermix any other businesses, but shall study this only to preserve thy spirit unpolluted, and pure,...", 1
"...thou shalt live happily; and from this, there is no man that can hinder thee.", 1
"As physicians and chirurgeons have always their instruments ready at hand for all sudden cures; so have thou always thy dogmata in a readiness for the knowledge of things, both divine and human:...", 1
"For without relation unto God, thou shalt never speed in any worldly actions; nor on the other side in any divine, without some respect had to things human.", 1
"Be not deceived; for thou shalt never live to read thy moral commentaries, nor the acts of the famous Romans and Grecians; nor those excerpta from several books; all which thou hadst provided and laid up for thyself against thine old age.", 1
"Hasten therefore to an end, and giving over all vain hopes, help thyself in time if thou carest for thyself, as thou oughtest to do.", 1
"To steal, to sow, to buy, to be at rest, to see what is to be done (which is not seen by the eyes, but by another kind of sight:) what these words mean, and how many ways to be understood, they do not understand.", 1
"The body, the soul, the understanding.", 1
"As the senses naturally belong to the body, and the desires and affections to the soul, so do the dogmata to the understanding.", 1

"How many astrologers, after that in great ostentation they had foretold the death of some others, how many philosophers after so many elaborate tracts and volumes concerning either mortality or immortality;...", 1
"...how many brave captains and commanders, after the death and slaughter of so many; how many kings and tyrants, after they had with such horror and insolency abused their power upon men's lives, as though themselves had been immortal;...", 1
"...how many, that I may so speak, whole cities both men and towns: Helice, Pompeii, Herculaneum, and others innumerable are dead and gone.", 1
"Run them over also, whom thou thyself, one after another, hast known in thy time to drop away.", 1
"So one, so another: and all things in a short time.", 1
"For herein lieth all indeed, ever to look upon all worldly things, as things for their continuance, that are but for a day: and for their worth, most vile, and contemptible,...", 1

"Thou must be like a promontory of the sea, against which though the waves beat continually, yet it both itself stands, and about it are those swelling waves stilled and quieted.", 3
"Oh, wretched I, to whom this mischance is happened!", 1
"nay, happy I, to whom this thing being happened, I can continue without grief; neither wounded by that which is present, nor in fear of that which is to come.", 1
"For as for this, it might have happened unto any man, but any man having such a thing befallen him, could not have continued without grief.", 1
"Why then should that rather be an unhappiness, than this a happiness?", 3
"But however, canst thou, O man! term that unhappiness, which is no mischance to the nature of man I Canst thou think that a mischance to the nature of man, which is not contrary to the end and will of his nature?", 3
"What then hast thou learned is the will of man's nature?", 1
"It is but an ordinary coarse one, yet it is a good effectual remedy against the fear of death, for a man to consider in his mind the examples of such, who greedily and covetously (as it were) did for a long time enjoy their lives.", 1
"What have they got more, than they whose deaths have been untimely?", 3
"Are not they themselves dead at the last?", 1
"The whole space of any man's life, is but little; and as little as it is, with what troubles, with what manner of dispositions, and in the society of how wretched a body must it be passed!", 1
"Let it be therefore unto thee altogether as a matter of indifferency.", 1
"For if thou shalt look backward; behold, what an infinite chaos of time doth present itself unto thee; and as infinite a chaos, if thou shalt look forward.", 1
"In that which is so infinite, what difference can there be between that which liveth but three days, and that which liveth three ages?", 3
"Let thy course ever be the most compendious way.", 1
"The most compendious, is that which is according to nature: that is, in all both words and deeds, ever to follow that which is most sound and perfect.", 1
"For such a resolution will free a man from all trouble, strife, dissembling, and ostentation.", 1
"With some difficulty I got a fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye.", 1
"This was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I could not but be touched.", 1
"I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard.", 1
"Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the box-seat--“gotza” they call them--cracked his big whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on our journey.", 1
"I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have been able to throw them off so easily.", 1
"Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road.", 1
"There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple, plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals.", 1
"The road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste.", 1
"I could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund.", 1
"I was told that this road is in summertime excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows.", 1
"In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order.", 3
"Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.", 3
"Right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly.", 1
"Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water.", 1
"One of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to be right before us:--", 1
"As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us.", 1
"This was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink.", 1
"Here and there we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent.", 1
"By the roadside were many crosses, and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves.", 1
"There were many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves.", 1
"As the evening fell it began to get very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of late-lying snow.", 1
"I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home, but the driver would not hear of it.", 1
"“No, no,” he said; “you must not walk here; the dogs are too fierce”;", 1
"and then he added, with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest--“and you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep.”", 3
"The only stop he would make was a moment’s pause to light his lamps.", 1
"When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as though urging him to further speed.", 1
"He lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions.", 1
"Then through the darkness I could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the hills.", 1
"The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea.", 1
"The road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along.", 1
"Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass.", 1
"One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial.", 1
"these were certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.", 1
"Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the darkness.", 1
"It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation.", 1
"There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder.", 1
"It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous one.", 1
"I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the Count.", 1
"Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark.", 1
"The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud.", 1
"We could see now the sandy road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.", 1
"The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock my own disappointment.", 3
"I was already thinking what I had best do, when the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone.", 1
"“There is no carriage here.", 1
"He will now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better the next day.”", 3
"Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up.", 1
"Then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach.", 1
"I could see from the flash of our lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and splendid animals.", 1
"They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us.", 1
"I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us.", 1
"“You are early to-night, my friend.”", 3
"“The English Herr was in a hurry,” to which the stranger replied:--", 1
"“That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina.", 3
"You cannot deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.”", 3
"As he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory.", 1
"The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a gleaming smile.", 1
"The passenger turned his face away, at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself.", 1
"“Give me the Herr’s luggage,” said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the calèche.", 1
"Then I descended from the side of the coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been prodigious.", 1
"Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we swept into the darkness of the Pass.", 1
"As I looked back I saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves.", 1
"Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept on their way to Bukovina.", 1
"As they sank into the darkness I felt a strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in excellent German:--", 1
"“The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all care of you.", 1
"There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.”", 1
"I did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same.", 3
"I felt a little strangely, and not a little frightened.", 1
"I think had there been any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey.", 1
"The carriage went at a hard pace straight along, then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road.", 1
"It seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was so.", 1
"I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay.", 1
"By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was within a few minutes of midnight.", 1
"This gave me a sort of shock, for I suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences.", 1
"Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a long, agonised wailing, as if from fear.", 1
"The sound was taken up by another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night.", 1
"At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright.", 1
"Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting.", 1
"In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them.", 1
"He petted and soothed them, and whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became quite manageable again, though they still trembled.", 1
"The driver again took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace.", 1
"This time, after going to the far side of reluctPass, he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.", 1
"Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side.", 1
"Though we were in shelter, we could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.", 1
"It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket.", 1
"The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way.", 1
"The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side.", 1
"I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear.", 1
"The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.", 1
"Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame.", 1
"The driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and, jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness.", 1
"I did not know what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took his seat, and we resumed our journey.", 1
"Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness around us I could watch the driver’s motions.", 1
"This startled me, but as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness.", 1
"Then for a time there were no blue flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.", 1
"At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright.", 1
"I could not see any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair.", 1
"They were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.", 1
"For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear.", 1
"It is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import.", 1
"All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them.", 1
"The horses jumped about and reared, and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see; but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they had perforce to remain within it.", 1
"I called to the coachman to come, for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach.", 1
"How he came there, I know not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway.", 1
"As he swept his long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still.", 1
"Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.", 1
"When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the wolves had disappeared.", 1
"This was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move.", 1
"The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon.", 1
"Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.", 1
"I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place.", 1
"In the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is.", 3
"I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.", 1
"When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand to assist me to alight.", 1
"Again I could not but notice his prodigious strength.", 1
"His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had chosen.", 1
"Then he took out my traps, and placed them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone.", 1
"I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do.", 1
"The time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon me.", 1
"What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?", 3
"What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked?", 3
"Was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitor’s clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner?", 3
"But my flesh answered the pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived.", 1
"All I could do now was to be patient, and to wait the coming of the morning.", 1
"Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light.", 1
"Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of massive bolts drawn back.", 1
"A key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse, and the great door swung back.", 1
"Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck of colour about him anywhere.", 1
"“Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!”", 3
"He made no motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone.", 1
"The instant, however, that I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince, an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as ice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man.", 1
"Again he said:-- “Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the happiness you bring!”", 3
"“Count Dracula?”", 1
"“I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house.", 1
"Come in; the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.”", 1
"“Nay, sir, you are my guest.", 1
"It is late, and my people are not available.", 3
"Let me see to your comfort myself.”", 3
"At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper, and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished, flamed and flared.", 1
"Passing through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter.", 1
"The Count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the door:--", 1
"“You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your toilet.", 1
"When you are ready, come into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.”", 1
"The light and warmth and the Count’s courteous welcome seemed to have dissipated all my doubts and fears.", 1
"Having then reached my normal state, I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty toilet, I went into the other room.", 1
"I found supper already laid out.", 1
"My host, who stood on one side of the great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of his hand to the table, and said:--", 1
"“I pray you, be seated and sup how you please.", 1
"You will, I trust, excuse me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.”", 3
"I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.", 1
"He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed it to me to read.", 1
"One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of pleasure.", 1
"The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken.", 1
"This, with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was my supper.", 1
"During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had experienced.", 1
"By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host’s desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me, at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke.", 1
"I had now an opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked physiognomy.", 1
"His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion.", 1
"The mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years.", 1
"For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm though thin.", 1
"The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.", 1
"As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not repress a shudder.", 1
"The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the fireplace.", 1
"We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn.", 1
"There seemed a strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves.", 1
"The Count’s eyes gleamed, and he said:-- “Listen to them--the children of the night.", 3
"What music they make!”", 3
"Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he added:-- “Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the hunter.”", 3
"Then he rose and said:-- “But you must be tired.", 1
"Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you shall sleep as late as you will.", 1
"I have to be away till the afternoon; so sleep well and dream well!”", 3
"With a courteous bow, he opened for me himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....", 1
"I am all in a sea of wonders.", 1
"I doubt; I fear; I think strange things, which I dare not confess to my own soul.", 1
"When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the pot being placed on the hearth.", 1
"“I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D.”", 1
"When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.", 1
"There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me.", 3
"The table service is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.", 1
"But still in none of the rooms is there a mirror.", 1
"There is not even a toilet glass on my table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I could either shave or brush my hair.", 1
"I have not yet seen a servant anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.", 1
"There was absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of library.", 1
"The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.", 1
"In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers.", 1
"A table in the centre was littered with English magazines and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date.", 1
"Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count entered.", 1
"He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good night’s rest.", 1
"“I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that will interest you.", 1
"These companions”--and he laid his hand on some of the books--“have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours of pleasure.", 3
"Through them I have come to know your great England; and to know her is to love her.", 3
"“But, Count,” I said, “you know and speak English thoroughly!”", 1
"“I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel.", 3
"True, I know the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.”", 3
"“Indeed,” I said, “you speak excellently.”", 1
"Here I am noble; I am boyar; the common people know me, and I am master.", 1
"But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men know him not--and to know not is to care not for.", 1
"I am content if I am like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his speaking if he hear my words, ‘Ha, ha! a stranger!’", 1
"I have been so long master that I would be master still--or at least that none other should be master of me.", 3
"You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London.", 1
"“You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are locked, where of course you will not wish to go.", 3
"There is reason that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.”", 3
"“We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England.", 1
"Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things.", 1
"He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed.", 1
"The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long, sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--", 1
"“Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool!", 3
"“There you are right,” I said.", 1
"Whilst I was placing them in order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark.", 1
"The lamps were also lit in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa, reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw’s Guide.", 1
"When I came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts.", 1
"He was interested in everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings.", 1
"When I remarked this, he answered:-- “Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should?", 3
"So!”", 3
"When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a place.", 1
"It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure, built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of years.", 1
"The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with rust.", 1
"There are many trees on it, which make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and flows away in a fair-sized stream.", 1
"When I had finished, he said:-- “I am glad that it is old and big.", 1
"I myself am of an old family, and to live in a new house would kill me.", 3
"A house cannot be made habitable in a day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century.", 1
"I rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times.", 1
"Somehow his words and his look did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his smile look malignant and saturnine.", 3
"Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers together.", 1
"He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of the books around me.", 1
"One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at England, as if that map had been much used.", 1
"On looking at it I found in certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the Yorkshire coast.", 1
"It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned.", 1
"“Aha!” he said; “still at your books?", 1
"But you must not work always.", 1
"Come; I am informed that your supper is ready.”", 1
"He took my arm, and we went into the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table.", 1
"The Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from home.", 3
"But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.", 1
"I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host’s wishes in every way.", 1
"“Why, there is the morning again!", 1
"You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by us,” and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.", 3
"I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the warm grey of quickening sky.", 1
"I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had never come.", 1
"If there were any one to talk to I could bear it, but there is no one.", 1
"I have only the Count to speak with, and he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place.", 3
"Let me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and imagination must not run riot with me.", 1
"I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could not sleep any more, got up.", 1
"I had hung my shaving glass by the window, and was just beginning to shave.", 1
"Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, and heard the Count’s voice saying to me, “Good-morning.”", 1
"In starting I had cut myself slightly, but did not notice it at the moment.", 1
"Having answered the Count’s salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.", 1
"This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I could see him over my shoulder.", 1
"But there was no reflection of him in the mirror!", 1
"The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no sign of a man in it, except myself.", 1
"This was startling, and, coming on the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near.", 1
"I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half round to look for some sticking plaster.", 1
"When the Count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat.", 1
"“Take care,” he said, “take care how you cut yourself.", 3
"It is more dangerous than you think in this country.”", 3
"Then seizing the shaving glass, he went on: “And this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief.", 1
"It is a foul bauble of man’s vanity.", 3
"Away with it!” and opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below.", 1
"Then he withdrew without a word.", 1
"It is very annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.", 1
"When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could not find the Count anywhere.", 1
"So I breakfasted alone.", 1
"It is strange that as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink.", 3
"He must be a very peculiar man!", 3
"After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle.", 1
"I went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South.", 1
"The view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity of seeing it.", 1
"A stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without touching anything!", 1
"As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm.", 1
"But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and bolted.", 1
"In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available exit.", 1
"The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!", 1
"When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.", 1
"I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings.", 1
"I am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion.", 1
"He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive me if I trusted him fully with the facts.", 1
"So far as I can see, my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes open.", 1
"I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears, or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and shall need, all my brains to get through.", 1
"I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below shut, and knew that the Count had returned.", 1
"He did not come at once into the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making the bed.", 1
"This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along thought--that there were no servants in the house.", 3
"This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here.", 1
"This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his hand in silence.", 3
"How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me?", 3
"In his speaking of things and people, and especially of battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all.", 3
"I wish I could put down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most fascinating.", 1
"It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country.", 1
"He grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength.", 1
"“We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship.", 1
"Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as Attila, whose blood is in these veins?”", 3
"He held up his arms.", 1
"Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.”", 3
"It was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed.", 1
"First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more.", 1
"I told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate against his interest.", 1
"He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor.", 1
"I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any chance mislead him, so he said:--", 1
"“I shall illustrate.", 1
"“Of course,” I replied; and “such is often done by men of business, who do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.”", 1
"For a man who was never in the country, and who did not evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were wonderful.", 1
"When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books available, he suddenly stood up and said:--", 1
"“Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter Hawkins, or to any other?”", 1
"It was with some bitterness in my heart that I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of sending letters to anybody.", 1
"“Then write now, my young friend,” he said, laying a heavy hand on my shoulder: “write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.”", 1
"“Do you wish me to stay so long?” I asked, for my heart grew cold at the thought.", 1
"“I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal.", 3
"When your master, employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf, it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted.", 3
"Is it not so?”", 3
"What could I do but bow acceptance?", 1
"As he spoke he handed me three sheets of note-paper and three envelopes.", 1
"They were all of the thinnest foreign post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile, with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for he would be able to read it.", 3
"So I determined to write only formal notes now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he did see it.", 1
"When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to some books on his table.", 1
"Then he took up my two and placed them with his own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which were face down on the table.", 1
"I felt no compunction in doing so, for under the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way I could.", 1
"I was just about to look at them when I saw the door-handle move.", 1
"He took up the letters on the table and stamped them carefully, and then turning to me, said:--", 1
"“I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this evening.", 3
"You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.”", 3
"At the door he turned, and after a moment’s pause said:--", 1
"“Let me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with all seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle.", 3
"It is old, and has many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely.", 3
"But if you be not careful in this respect, then”--He finished his speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were washing them.", 3
"When he left me I went to my room.", 1
"After a little while, not hearing any sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out towards the South.", 1
"Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of the night.", 1
"I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.", 1
"It is destroying my nerve.", 1
"I start at my own shadow, and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings.", 1
"God knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place!", 1
"I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day.", 1
"In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness.", 1
"The mere beauty seemed to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew.", 1
"What I saw was the Count’s head coming out from the window.", 1
"I did not see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his back and arms.", 1
"In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had so many opportunities of studying.", 1
"I was at first interested and somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner.", 1
"But my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss, face down with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings.", 1
"At first I could not believe my eyes.", 1
"I thought it was some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could be no delusion.", 1
"What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the semblance of man?", 3
"I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering me; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I am encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....", 1
"Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.", 1
"He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good deal to the left.", 1
"He vanished into some hole or window.", 1
"When his head had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without avail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight.", 1
"I knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than I had dared to do as yet.", 1
"I went back to the room, and taking a lamp, tried all the doors.", 1
"They were all locked, as I had expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally.", 1
"I found I could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the door was locked, and the key was gone!", 1
"That key must be in the Count’s room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and escape.", 1
"At last, however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure.", 1
"I tried it harder, and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door rested on the floor.", 1
"Here was an opportunity which I might not have again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that I could enter.", 1
"The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth.", 1
"My lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble.", 1
"Here I am, sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last.", 1
"And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own which mere “modernity” cannot kill.", 3
"Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way lies madness indeed.", 1
"The Count’s mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens me more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon me.", 1
"I shall fear to doubt what he may say!", 3
"When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and pen in my pocket I felt sleepy.", 1
"The Count’s warning came into my mind, but I took a pleasure in disobeying it.", 3
"I was not alone.", 1
"The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight, my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of dust.", 1
"In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by their dress and manner.", 1
"I thought at the time that I must be dreaming when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw no shadow on the floor.", 1
"Two were dark, and had high aquiline noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon.", 1
"The other was fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires.", 1
"All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips.", 1
"There was something about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some deadly fear.", 1
"I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips.", 1
"It is not good to note this down, lest some day it should meet Mina’s eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.", 1
"“Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to begin.”", 1
"“He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.”", 1
"I lay quiet, looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.", 1
"The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement of her breath upon me.", 1
"I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes.", 1
"The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply gloating.", 1
"There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth.", 1
"Then she paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck.", 1
"I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating heart.", 1
"I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury.", 1
"But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to the demons of the pit.", 1
"His eyes were positively blazing.", 1
"His face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires; the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white-hot metal.", 1
"“How dare you touch him, any of you?", 1
"How dare you cast eyes on him when I had forbidden it?", 1
"This man belongs to me!", 1
"Beware how you meddle with him, or you’ll have to deal with me.”", 1
"“You yourself never loved; you never love!”", 3
"“Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past.", 3
"Is it not so?", 3
"Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall kiss him at your will.", 3
"Now go! go!", 1
"I must awaken him, for there is work to be done.”", 3
"“Are we to have nothing to-night?” said one of them, with a low laugh, as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which moved as though there were some living thing within it.", 3
"For answer he nodded his head.", 1
"If my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a half-smothered child.", 1
"Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.", 1
"I awoke in my own bed.", 1
"If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must have carried me here.", 1
"To be sure, there were certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by in a manner which was not my habit.", 1
"My watch was still unwound, and I am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and many such details.", 1
"I am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not have brooked.", 3
"He would have taken or destroyed it.", 1
"As I look round this room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who were--who are--waiting to suck my blood.", 1
"I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for I must know the truth.", 1
"When I got to the doorway at the top of the stairs I found it closed.", 1
"I could see that the bolt of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.", 1
"I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.", 1
"I am surely in the toils.", 1
"Last night the Count asked me in the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days, another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at Bistritz.", 1
"He knows that I know too much, and that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to prolong my opportunities.", 1
"Something may occur which will give me a chance to escape.", 1
"I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked him what dates I should put on the letters.", 1
"He calculated a minute, and then said:--", 1
"“The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June 29.”", 1
"I know now the span of my life.", 3
"God help me!", 1
"There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to send word home.", 1
"A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are encamped in the courtyard.", 1
"These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of them in my book.", 1
"I have given the letters; I threw them through the bars of my window with a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted.", 1
"The man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them in his cap.", 1
"I could do no more.", 1
"The Count has come.", 1
"“The Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they come, I shall, of course, take care.", 3
"And he calmly held letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed.", 1
"He held out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean envelope.", 1
"I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence.", 1
"A minute later I went over and tried it, and the door was locked.", 1
"“So, my friend, you are tired?", 3
"Get to bed.", 1
"There is the surest rest.", 3
"I may not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours to me; but you will sleep, I pray.”", 3
"Despair has its own calms.", 3
"This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, so that I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a surprise, again a shock!", 1
"Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda, relating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that might be useful to me were I once outside the castle.", 1
"The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and rug; I could find no trace of them anywhere.", 1
"This looked like some new scheme of villainy....", 1
"This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed cudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding and scraping of horses’ feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.", 1
"With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty sheepskin, and high boots.", 1
"I ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them.", 1
"Again a shock: my door was fastened on the outside.", 1
"Then I ran to the window and cried to them.", 1
"They looked up at me stupidly and pointed, but just then the “hetman” of the Szgany came out, and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they laughed.", 1
"Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised entreaty, would make them even look at me.", 1
"They resolutely turned away.", 1
"Shortly afterwards, I heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.", 1
"Last night the Count left me early, and locked himself into his own room.", 1
"As soon as I dared I ran up the winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south.", 1
"I thought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.", 1
"The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of some kind.", 1
"I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw something coming out of the Count’s window.", 1
"I drew back and watched carefully, and saw the whole man emerge.", 1
"It was a new shock to me to find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I had seen the women take away.", 1
"It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which is even a criminal’s right and consolation.", 1
"Then I began to notice that there were some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight.", 1
"Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight.", 1
"The phantom shapes, which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the three ghostly women to whom I was doomed.", 1
"I fled, and felt somewhat safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp was burning brightly.", 1
"When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the Count’s room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me.", 1
"With a beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and could do nothing.", 1
"As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of a woman.", 1
"I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between the bars.", 1
"There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her hands over her heart as one distressed with running.", 1
"She was leaning against a corner of the gateway.", 1
"When she saw my face at the window she threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--", 1
"“Monster, give me my child!”", 1
"Then she tore her hair and beat her breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant emotion.", 1
"Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.", 1
"Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper.", 1
"His call seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves.", 1
"Before many minutes had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated, through the wide entrance into the courtyard.", 1
"There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but short.", 1
"Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.", 1
"I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and she was better dead.", 3
"What shall I do? what can I do?", 3
"How can I escape from this dreadful thing of night and gloom and fear?", 3
"When the sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me as if the dove from the ark had lighted there.", 1
"My fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth.", 1
"I must take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me.", 1
"Let me not think of it.", 1
"Action!", 1
"It has always been at night-time that I have been molested or threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear.", 1
"I have not yet seen the Count in the daylight.", 1
"Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that he may be awake whilst they sleep?", 3
"But there is no possible way.", 1
"Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it.", 3
"Where his body has gone why may not another body go?", 3
"I have seen him myself crawl from his window.", 1
"Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window?", 3
"The chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still.", 1
"I shall risk it.", 1
"At the worst it can only be death; and a man’s death is not a calf’s, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me.", 1
"I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have come safely back to this room.", 1
"I must put down every detail in order.", 1
"The stones are big and roughly cut, and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them.", 1
"I took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way.", 1
"I looked down once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it.", 1
"The room was empty!", 1
"The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one corner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as though it had lain long in the ground.", 1
"There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count!", 1
"He was either dead or asleep, I could not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the glassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor; the lips were as red as ever.", 1
"I bent over him, and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain.", 1
"By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.", 1
"Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think....", 1
"To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has taken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the castle by the same window, and in my clothes.", 1
"As he went down the wall, lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might destroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man’s hand would have any effect on him.", 1
"I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared to see those weird sisters.", 1
"I came back to the library, and read there till I fell asleep.", 1
"I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can look as he said:--", 1
"“To-morrow, my friend, we must part.", 1
"You return to your beautiful England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never meet.", 3
"Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be here, but all shall be ready for your journey.", 1
"Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:--", 3
"“Why may I not go to-night?”", 1
"“Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.”", 3
"“But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.”", 1
"He smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick behind his smoothness.", 1
"“And your baggage?”", 3
"“I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.”", 1
"The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my eyes, it seemed so real:--", 1
"“You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is that which rules our boyars: ‘Welcome the coming; speed the parting guest.’", 3
"Come with me, my dear young friend.", 3
"Close at hand came the howling of many wolves.", 1
"It was almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great orchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor.", 1
"To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked.", 1
"Suspiciously, I looked all round, but could see no key of any kind.", 1
"As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door.", 1
"I knew then that to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless.", 1
"With such allies as these at his command, I could do nothing.", 1
"But still the door continued slowly to open, and only the Count’s body stood in the gap.", 1
"Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation.", 1
"There was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and as a last chance I cried out:--", 1
"“Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!” and covered my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment.", 1
"With one sweep of his powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.", 1
"In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went to my own room.", 1
"The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that Judas in hell might be proud of.", 3
"When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a whispering at my door.", 1
"I went to it softly and listened.", 1
"Unless my ears deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:--", 1
"“Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have patience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!”", 3
"There was a low, sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw without the three terrible women licking their lips.", 1
"As I appeared they all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.", 1
"I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees.", 1
"It is then so near the end?", 3
"To-morrow! to-morrow!", 1
"Lord, help me, and those to whom I am dear!", 1
"These may be the last words I ever write in this diary.", 1
"I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself on my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me ready.", 1
"At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning had come.", 1
"Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe.", 1
"With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall.", 1
"I had seen that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me.", 1
"With hands that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the massive bolts.", 1
"But the door would not move.", 1
"Despair seized me.", 1
"I pulled, and pulled, at the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its casement.", 1
"I could see the bolt shot.", 1
"It had been locked after I left the Count.", 1
"Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count’s room.", 1
"He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of evils.", 3
"Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled down the wall, as before, into the Count’s room.", 1
"It was empty, but that was as I expected.", 1
"I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold remained.", 1
"I went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel.", 1
"I knew now well enough where to find the monster I sought.", 1
"The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home.", 1
"There lay the Count, but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck.", 1
"Even the deep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated.", 1
"It seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood.", 1
"He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion.", 1
"I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost.", 1
"The coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three.", 1
"I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the key.", 1
"Then I stopped and looked at the Count.", 1
"There was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad.", 1
"This was the being I was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the helpless.", 1
"The very thought drove me mad.", 1
"A terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster.", 1
"There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face.", 1
"But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror.", 1
"The sight seemed to paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face, merely making a deep gash above the forehead.", 1
"I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me.", 1
"As I waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had spoken were coming.", 1
"With a last look around and at the box which contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count’s room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.", 1
"With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door.", 1
"There must have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of the locked doors.", 3
"Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo.", 1
"When I ran to push it open, I found that it was hopelessly fast.", 1
"I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing round me more closely.", 1
"As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes, with their freight of earth.", 1
"There is a sound of hammering; it is the box being nailed down.", 1
"Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.", 1
"The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key in the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and shuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.", 1
"I am alone in the castle with those awful women.", 1
"They are devils of the Pit!", 1
"I shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wall farther than I have yet attempted.", 1
"I shall take some of the gold with me, lest I want it later.", 1
"I may find a way from this dreadful place.", 1
"And then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train!", 1
"At least God’s mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the precipice is steep and high.", 3
"At its foot a man may sleep--as a man.", 3
"Good-bye, all!", 1
"Mina!", 1
"Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed with work.", 1
"The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.", 1
"I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together freely and build our castles in the air.", 1
"I have been working very hard lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan’s studies, and I have been practising shorthand very assiduously.", 1
"When we are married I shall be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for him on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard.", 1
"He and I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a stenographic journal of his travels abroad.", 1
"When I am with you I shall keep a diary in the same way.", 1
"I do not suppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not intended for them.", 3
"I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book.", 1
"I am told that, with a little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears said during a day.", 1
"I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan from Transylvania.", 1
"He is well, and will be returning in about a week.", 1
"I am longing to hear all his news.", 1
"It must be so nice to see strange countries.", 1
"I wonder if we--I mean Jonathan and I--shall ever see them together.", 1
"There is the ten o’clock bell ringing.", 1
"Tell me all the news when you write.", 1
"You have not told me anything for a long time.", 1
"I hear rumours, and especially of a tall, handsome, curly-haired man???", 3
"I must say you tax me very unfairly with being a bad correspondent.", 1
"Besides, I have nothing to tell you.", 3
"There is really nothing to interest you.", 3
"Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park.", 1
"As to the tall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the last Pop.", 1
"Some one has evidently been telling tales.", 3
"That was Mr. Holmwood.", 1
"He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well together; they have so many things to talk about in common.", 1
"We met some time ago a man that would just do for you, if you were not already engaged to Jonathan.", 1
"He is an excellent parti, being handsome, well off, and of good birth.", 1
"He is a doctor and really clever.", 1
"Just fancy! He is only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under his own care.", 1
"Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to see us, and often comes now.", 1
"I think he is one of the most resolute men I ever saw, and yet the most calm.", 1
"He seems absolutely imperturbable.", 1
"I can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients.", 1
"He has a curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to read one’s thoughts.", 1
"He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack.", 3
"He says that I afford him a curious psychological study, and I humbly think I do.", 3
"Dress is a bore.", 1
"There, it is all out.", 1
"Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other since we were children; we have slept together and eaten together, and laughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like to speak more.", 1
"Oh, Mina, couldn’t you guess?", 3
"I love him.", 1
"I am blushing as I write, for although I think he loves me, he has not told me so in words.", 1
"But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him!", 1
"There, that does me good.", 1
"I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire undressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel.", 1
"I do not know how I am writing this even to you.", 1
"I am afraid to stop, or I should tear up the letter, and I don’t want to stop, for I do so want to tell you all.", 1
"Mina, I must stop.", 1
"Good-night.", 1
"Bless me in your prayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness.", 1
"I need not tell you this is a secret.", 3
"Good-night again.", 1
"Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter.", 1
"It was so nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.", 1
"My dear, it never rains but it pours.", 1
"How true the old proverbs are.", 1
"Isn’t it awful!", 3
"I feel sorry, really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows.", 1
"Oh, Mina, I am so happy that I don’t know what to do with myself.", 1
"And three proposals!", 1
"Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep it a secret, dear, from every one, except, of course, Jonathan.", 1
"A woman ought to tell her husband everything--don’t you think so, dear?--and I must be fair.", 1
"Men like women, certainly their wives, to be quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always quite as fair as they should be.", 3
"Well, my dear, number One came just before lunch.", 1
"He was very cool outwardly, but was nervous all the same.", 1
"He spoke to me, Mina, very straightforwardly.", 1
"He told me how dear I was to him, though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to help and cheer him.", 1
"Oh, Mina dear, I can’t help crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted.", 1
"My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so miserable, though I am so happy.", 1
"Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left off, so I can go on telling you about the day.", 1
"Well, my dear, number Two came after lunch.", 1
"He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he has been to so many places and has had such adventures.", 1
"Mr. Quincey P. Morris found me alone.", 1
"It seems that a man always does find a girl alone.", 3
"Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn’t seem half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I wasn’t broken to harness at all yet.", 1
"He really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn’t help feeling a bit serious too--I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid flirt--though I couldn’t help feeling a sort of exultation that he was number two in one day.", 1
"And then, my dear, before I could say a word he began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very heart and soul at my feet.", 1
"I suppose he saw something in my face which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:--", 1
"My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy of them?", 3
"Why can’t they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want her, and save all this trouble?", 3
"But this is heresy, and I must not say it.", 1
"I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into Mr. Morris’s brave eyes, and I told him out straight:--", 1
"“Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he even loves me.”", 1
"I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a light came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine--I think I put them into his--and said in a hearty way:--", 1
"That quite won me, Mina, for it was brave and sweet of him, and noble, too, to a rival--wasn’t it?--and he so sad; so I leant over and kissed him.", 1
"He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat, went straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a quiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby.", 1
"Oh, why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would worship the very ground he trod on?", 3
"I know I would if I were free--only I don’t want to be free.", 1
"My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I cannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I don’t wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.", 1
"Oh, about number Three--I needn’t tell you of number Three, need I?", 3
"Besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only a moment from his coming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was kissing me.", 1
"I am very, very happy, and I don’t know what I have done to deserve it.", 1
"I must only try in the future to show that I am not ungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a lover, such a husband, and such a friend.", 1
"Ebb tide in appetite to-day.", 1
"Since my rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty feeling; nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth the doing....", 1
"He is so quaint that I am determined to understand him as well as I can.", 1
"To-day I seemed to get nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.", 1
"In my manner of doing it there was, I now see, something of cruelty.", 1
"Hell has its price!", 3
"R. M. Renfield, ætat 59.--Sanguine temperament; great physical strength; morbidly excitable; periods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which I cannot make out.", 1
"I presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the disturbing influence end in a mentally-accomplished finish; a possibly dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish.", 1
"What I think of on this point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is balanced with the centrifugal; when duty, a cause, etc., is the fixed point, the latter force is paramount, and only accident or a series of accidents can balance it.", 1
"We’ve told yarns by the camp-fire in the prairies; and dressed one another’s wounds after trying a landing at the Marquesas; and drunk healths on the shore of Titicaca.", 1
"There are more yarns to be told, and other wounds to be healed, and another health to be drunk.", 1
"I have no hesitation in asking you, as I know a certain lady is engaged to a certain dinner-party, and that you are free.", 1
"There will only be one other, our old pal at the Korea, Jack Seward.", 1
"We promise you a hearty welcome, and a loving greeting, and a health as true as your own right hand.", 1
"We shall both swear to leave you at home if you drink too deep to a certain pair of eyes.", 3
"Count me in every time.", 1
"I bear messages which will make both your ears tingle.", 3
"Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in which they have rooms.", 1
"This is a lovely place.", 1
"The little river, the Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the harbour.", 1
"The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the pictures we see of Nuremberg.", 1 
"John Stuart Mill was born on 20th May 1806.", 1
"His exercise was taken in the form of walks with his father, during which the elder Mill lectured his son and examined him on his work.", 1
"Mill remained delicate throughout his life, but was endowed with that intense mental energy which is so often combined with physical weakness.", 1
"His youth was sacrificed to an idea; he was designed by his father to carry on his work; the individuality of the boy was unimportant.", 3
"A visit to the south of France at the age of fourteen, in company with the family of General Sir Samuel Bentham, was not without its influence.", 1
"It was a glimpse of another atmosphere, though the studious habits of his home life were maintained.", 1
"Moreover, he derived from it his interest in foreign politics, which remained one of his characteristics to the end of his life.", 1
"In 1823 he was appointed junior clerk in the Examiners' Office at the India House.", 1
"From that time forward his literary work was uninterrupted save by attacks of illness.", 1
"His industry was stupendous.", 1
"He wrote articles on an infinite variety of subjects, political, metaphysical, philosophic, religious, poetical.", 1
"He discovered Tennyson for his generation, he influenced the writing of Carlyle's French Revolution as well as its success.", 1
"And all the while he was engaged in studying and preparing for his more ambitious works, while he rose step by step at the India Office.", 1
"His Essays on Unsettled Questions in Political Economy were written in 1831, although they did not appear until thirteen years later.", 1
"In 1844 appeared the article on Michelet, which its author anticipated would cause some discussion, but which did not create the sensation he expected.", 1
"""Next year there were the ""Claims of Labour"" and ""Guizot,"" and in 1847 his articles on Irish affairs in the Morning Chronicle.""", 1
"These years were very much influenced by his friendship and correspondence with Comte, a curious comradeship between men of such different temperament.", 1
"In 1848 Mill published his Political Economy, to which he had given his serious study since the completion of his Logic.", 1
"The year 1856 saw him head of the Examiners' Office in the India House, and another two years brought the end of his official work, owing to the transfer of India to the Crown.", 1
"Liberty was published shortly after, as well as the Thoughts on Parliamentary Reform, and no year passed without Mill making important contributions on the political, philosophical, and ethical questions of the day.", 1
"Seven years after the death of his wife, Mill was invited to contest Westminster.", 1
"His feeling on the conduct of elections made him refuse to take any personal action in the matter, and he gave the frankest expression to his political views, but nevertheless he was elected by a large majority.", 1
"He was not a conventional success in the House; as a speaker he lacked magnetism.", 1
"But his influence was widely felt.", 1
"""For the sake of the House of Commons at large,"" said Mr. Gladstone, ""I rejoiced in his advent and deplored his disappearance.""", 1
"He did us all good.", 1
"After only three years in Parliament, he was defeated at the next General Election by Mr. W. H. Smith.", 1
"He retired to Avignon, to the pleasant little house where the happiest years of his life had been spent in the companionship of his wife, and continued his disinterested labours.", 1
"He completed his edition of his father's Analysis of the Mind, and also produced, in addition to less important work, The Subjection of Women, in which he had the active co-operation of his step-daughter.", 1
"A book on Socialism was under consideration, but, like an earlier study of Sociology, it never was written.", 1
"He died in 1873, his last years being spent peacefully in the pleasant society of his step-daughter, from whose tender care and earnest intellectual sympathy he caught maybe a far-off reflection of the light which had irradiated his spiritual life.", 1
"The circumstances under which John Stuart Mill wrote his Liberty are largely connected with the influence which Mrs. Taylor wielded over his career.", 1
"The dedication is well known.", 1
"It contains the most extraordinary panegyric on a woman that any philosopher has ever penned.", 1
"It is easy for the ordinary worldly cynicism to curl a sceptical lip over sentences like these.", 3
"The treatise on Liberty was written especially under her authority and encouragement, but there are many earlier references to the power which she exercised over his mind.", 1
"The acquaintance rapidly ripened into intimacy and the intimacy into friendship, and Mill was never weary of expatiating on all the advantages of so singular a relationship.", 1
"We shall hardly be wrong in attributing a much later book, The Subjection of Women, published in 1869, to the influence wielded by Mrs. Taylor.", 1
"The facts of this remarkable intimacy can easily be stated.", 1
"The deductions are more difficult.", 1
"There is no question that Mill's infatuation was the cause of considerable trouble to his acquaintances and friends.", 1
"His father openly taxed him with being in love with another man's wife.", 1
"Mrs. Taylor lived with her daughter in a lodging in the country; but in 1851 her husband died, and then Mill made her his wife.", 1
"Opinions were widely divergent as to her merits; but every one agreed that up to the time of her death, in 1858, Mill was wholly lost to his friends.", 1
"""George Mill, one of Mill's younger brothers, gave it as his opinion that she was a clever and remarkable woman, but ""nothing like what John took her to be.""", 1
"Carlyle, in his reminiscences, described her with ambiguous epithets.", 1
"""She was ""vivid,"" ""iridescent,"" ""pale and passionate and sad-looking, a living-romance heroine of the royalist volition and questionable destiny.""", 1
"""It is not possible to make much of a judgment like this, but we get on more certain ground when we discover that Mrs. Carlyle said on one occasion that ""she is thought to be dangerous,"" and that Carlyle added that she was worse than dangerous, she was patronising.""", 1
"The manuscript of the first volume of the French Revolution had been lent to Mill, and was accidentally burnt by Mrs. Mill's servant.", 1
"Mill and his wife drove up to Carlyle's door, the wife speechless, the husband so full of conversation that he detained Carlyle with desperate attempts at loquacity for two hours.", 1
"But Dr. Garnett tells us, in his Life of Carlyle, that Mill made a substantial reparation for the calamity for which he was responsible by inducing the aggrieved author to accept half of the £200 which he offered.", 1
"Mrs. Mill, as I have said, died in 1858, after seven years of happy companionship with her husband, and was buried at Avignon.", 1
"The inscription which Mill wrote for her grave is too characteristic to be omitted:--", 1
"These lines prove the intensity of Mill's feeling, which is not afraid of abundant verbiage; but they also prove that he could not imagine what the effect would be on others, and, as Grote said, only Mill's reputation could survive these and similar displays.", 3
"Every one will judge for himself of this romantic episode in Mill's career, according to such experience as he may possess of the philosophic mind and of the value of these curious but not infrequent relationships.", 1
"It may have been a piece of infatuation, or, if we prefer to say so, it may have been the most gracious and the most human page in Mill's career.", 1
"Mrs. Mill may have flattered her husband's vanity by echoing his opinions, or she may have indeed been an Egeria, full of inspiration and intellectual helpfulness.", 1
"Thus both parties to the happy contract are equally pleased.", 1
"The abstract truth gets the concrete illustration; the concrete illustration finds its proper foundation in a series of abstract inquiries.", 1
"""Perhaps Carlyle's epithets of ""iridescent"" and ""vivid"" refer incidentally to Mrs. Mill's quick perceptiveness, and thus throw a useful light on the mutual advantages of the common work of husband and wife.""", 1
"But it savours almost of impertinence even to attempt to lift the veil on a mystery like this.", 3
"It is enough to say, perhaps, that however much we may deplore the exaggeration of Mill's references to his wife, we recognise that, for whatever reason, the pair lived an ideally happy life.", 1
"It still, however, remains to estimate the extent to which Mrs. Taylor, both before and after her marriage with Mill, made actual contributions to his thoughts and his public work.", 1
"Mill gives us abundant help in this matter in the Autobiography.", 1
"When first he knew her, his thoughts were turning to the subject of Logic.", 1
"But his published work on the subject owed nothing to her, he tells us, in its doctrines.", 1
"It was Mill's custom to write the whole of a book so as to get his general scheme complete, and then laboriously to re-write it in order to perfect the phrases and the composition.", 1
"Doubtless Mrs. Taylor was of considerable help to him as a critic of style.", 1
"But to be a critic of doctrine she was hardly qualified.", 1
"Mill has made some clear admissions on this point.", 1
"""The only actual revolution which has ever taken place in my modes of thinking was already complete,""[2] he says, before her influence became paramount.""", 1
"There is a curiously humble estimate of his own powers (to which Dr. Bain has called attention), which reads at first sight as if it contradicted this.", 1
"So far it would seem that Mill had sat at the feet of his oracle; but observe the highly remarkable exception which is made in the following sentence:--", 1
"And to most men logic and metaphysics may be safely taken as forming a domain in which originality of thought, if it can be honestly professed, is a sufficient title of distinction.", 1
"Mrs. Taylor's assistance in the Political Economy is confined to certain definite points.", 1
"The purely scientific part was, we are assured, not learnt from her.", 1
"The part which is italicised is noticeable.", 1
"Here, as elsewhere, Mill thinks out the matter by himself; the concrete form of the thoughts is suggested or prompted by the wife.", 1
"""Apart from this ""general tone,"" Mill tells us that there was a specific contribution.""", 1
"The chapter which has had a greater influence on opinion than all the rest, that on the Probable Future of the Labouring Classes, is entirely due to her.", 1
"In the first draft of the book that chapter did not exist.", 1
"She pointed out the need of such a chapter, and the extreme imperfection of the book without it; she was the cause of my writing it.", 1
"From this it would appear that she gave Mill that tendency to Socialism which, while it lends a progressive spirit to his speculations on politics, at the same time does not manifestly accord with his earlier advocacy of peasant proprietorships.", 1
"The ideal of individual freedom is not the ideal of Socialism, just as that invocation of governmental aid to which the Socialist resorts is not consistent with the theory of laisser-faire.", 1
"Perhaps a slight visionariness of speculation was no less the attribute of Mrs. Mill than an absence of rigid logical principles.", 3
"Whether this was an instance of her steadying influence,[5] or whether it added one more unassimilated element to Mill's diverse intellectual sustenance, may be wisely left an open question.", 3
"We cannot, however, be wrong in attributing to her the parentage of one book of Mill, The Subjection of Women.", 1
"This was a point on which he had already fallen foul of his father's essay on Government.", 1
"But Mrs. Taylor had actually written on this very point, and the warmth and fervour of Mill's denunciations of women's servitude were unmistakably caught from his wife's view of the practical disabilities entailed by the feminine position.", 1
"Liberty was published in 1859, when the nineteenth century was half over, but in its general spirit and in some of its special tendencies the little tract belongs rather to the standpoint of the eighteenth century than to that which saw its birth.", 1
"In many of his speculations John Stuart Mill forms a sort of connecting link between the doctrines of the earlier English empirical school and those which we associate with the name of Mr. Herbert Spencer.", 1
"In his Logic, for instance, he represents an advance on the theories of Hume, and yet does not see how profoundly the victories of Science modify the conclusions of the earlier thinker.", 1
"Similarly, in his Political Economy, he desires to improve and to enlarge upon Ricardo, and yet does not advance so far as the modifications of political economy by Sociology, indicated by some later--and especially German--speculations on the subject.", 1
"In the tract on Liberty, Mill is advocating the rights of the individual as against Society at the very opening of an era that was rapidly coming to the conclusion that the individual had no absolute rights against Society.", 1
"The eighteenth century view is that individuals existed first, each with their own special claims and responsibilities; that they deliberately formed a Social State, either by a contract or otherwise; and that then finally they limited their own action out of regard for the interests of the social organism thus arbitrarily produced.", 1
"This is hardly the view of the nineteenth century.", 1
"It is possible that logically the individual is prior to the State; historically and in the order of Nature, the State is prior to the individual.", 1
"In other words, such rights as every single personality possesses in a modern world do not belong to him by an original ordinance of Nature, but are slowly acquired in the growth and development of the social state.", 1
"It is not the truth that individual liberties were forfeited by some deliberate act when men made themselves into a Commonwealth.", 1
"But if this is even approximately true, it seriously restricts that liberty of the individual for which Mill pleads.", 1
"The individual has no chance, because he has no rights, against the social organism.", 1
"Society can punish him for acts or even opinions which are anti-social in character.", 1
"His virtue lies in recognising the intimate communion with his fellows.", 1
"His sphere of activity is bounded by the common interest.", 1
"Just as it is an absurd and exploded theory that all men are originally equal, so it is an ancient and false doctrine to protest that a man has an individual liberty to live and think as he chooses in any spirit of antagonism to that larger body of which he forms an insignificant part.", 1
"Nowadays this view of Society and of its development, which we largely owe to the Philosophie Positive of M. Auguste Comte, is so familiar and possibly so damaging to the individual initiative, that it becomes necessary to advance and proclaim the truth which resides in an opposite theory.", 1
"All progress, as we are aware, depends on the joint process of integration and differentiation; synthesis, analysis, and then a larger synthesis seem to form the law of development.", 1
"If it ever comes to pass that Society is tyrannical in its restrictions of the individual, if, as for instance in some forms of Socialism, based on deceptive analogies of Nature's dealings, the type is everything and the individual nothing, it must be confidently urged in answer that the fuller life of the future depends on the manifold activities, even though they may be antagonistic, of the individual.", 1
"Just as our former point of view limited the value of Mill's treatise on Liberty, so these considerations tend to show its eternal importance.", 1
"The omnipotence of Society means a dead level of uniformity.", 1
"So long as individual initiative and effort are recognised as a vital element in English history, so long will Mill's Liberty, which he confesses was based on a suggestion derived from Von Humboldt, remain as an indispensable contribution to the speculations, and also to the health and sanity, of the world.", 1
"What his wife really was to Mill, we shall, perhaps, never know.", 3
"But that she was an actual and vivid force, which roused the latent enthusiasm of his nature, we have abundant evidence.", 1
"And when she died at Avignon, though his friends may have regained an almost estranged companionship, Mill was, personally, the poorer.", 1
"Into the sorrow of that bereavement we cannot enter: we have no right or power to draw the veil.", 3
"""It is enough to quote the simple words, so eloquent of an unspoken grief--""I can say nothing which could describe, even in the faintest manner, what that loss was and is.""", 1
"But because I know that she would have wished it, I endeavour to make the best of what life I have left, and to work for her purposes with such diminished strength as can be derived from thoughts of her, and communion with her memory.", 1
"The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails, and was at rest.", 1
"The flood had made, the wind was nearly calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide.", 1
"The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway.", 1
"In the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits.", 1
"A haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness.", 1
"The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth.", 3
"The Director of Companies was our captain and our host.", 1
"We four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward.", 1
"On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical.", 3
"He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified.", 1
"It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.", 1
"Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of the sea.", 1
"Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other’s yarns—and even convictions.", 1
"The Lawyer—the best of old fellows—had, because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck, and was lying on the only rug.", 3
"The Accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones.", 1
"Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast.", 1
"The director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way aft and sat down amongst us.", 1
"We exchanged a few words lazily.", 1
"Afterwards there was silence on board the yacht.", 1
"For some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes.", 1
"We felt meditative, and fit for nothing but placid staring.", 1
"The day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance.", 1
"The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the Essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds.", 1
"Only the gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more sombre every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.", 3
"And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the sun sank low, and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat, as if about to go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men.", 3
"Forthwith a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less brilliant but more profound.", 1
"The old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth.", 1
"We looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories.", 1
"And indeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes, “followed the sea” with reverence and affection, than to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames.", 1
"The tidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea.", 1
"It had known and served all the men of whom the nation is proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled and untitled—the great knights-errant of the sea.", 1
"It had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time, from the Golden Hind returning with her rotund flanks full of treasure, to be visited by the Queen’s Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale, to the Erebus and Terror, bound on other conquests—and that never returned.", 1
"It had known the ships and the men.", 1
"Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all had gone out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the torch, messengers of the might within the land, bearers of a spark from the sacred fire.", 1
"What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth!...", 3
"The sun set; the dusk fell on the stream, and lights began to appear along the shore.", 1
"The Chapman light-house, a three-legged thing erect on a mud-flat, shone strongly.", 1
"Lights of ships moved in the fairway—a great stir of lights going up and going down.", 1
"And farther west on the upper reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously on the sky, a brooding gloom in sunshine, a lurid glare under the stars.", 1
"“And this also,” said Marlow suddenly, “has been one of the dark places of the earth.”", 1
"He was the only man of us who still “followed the sea.”", 1
"The worst that could be said of him was that he did not represent his class.", 3
"He was a seaman, but he was a wanderer, too, while most seamen lead, if one may so express it, a sedentary life.", 1
"Their minds are of the stay-at-home order, and their home is always with them—the ship; and so is their country—the sea.", 1
"One ship is very much like another, and the sea is always the same.", 1
"In the immutability of their surroundings the foreign shores, the foreign faces, the changing immensity of life, glide past, veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance; for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself, which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny.", 1
"For the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or a casual spree on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent, and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing.", 3
"The yarns of seamen have a direct simplicity, the whole meaning of which lies within the shell of a cracked nut.", 1
"But Marlow was not typical (if his propensity to spin yarns be excepted), and to him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination of moonshine.", 1
"His remark did not seem at all surprising.", 1
"It was just like Marlow.", 3
"It was accepted in silence.", 1
"No one took the trouble to grunt even; and presently he said, very slow—“I was thinking of very old times, when the Romans first came here, nineteen hundred years ago—the other day ....", 1
"Yes; but it is like a running blaze on a plain, like a flash of lightning in the clouds.", 1
"We live in the flicker—may it last as long as the old earth keeps rolling!", 1
"But darkness was here yesterday.", 1
"Imagine him here—the very end of the world, a sea the colour of lead, a sky the colour of smoke, a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertina—and going up this river with stores, or orders, or what you like.", 1
"Sand-banks, marshes, forests, savages,—precious little to eat fit for a civilized man, nothing but Thames water to drink.", 1
"No Falernian wine here, no going ashore.", 1
"Here and there a military camp lost in a wilderness, like a needle in a bundle of hay—cold, fog, tempests, disease, exile, and death—death skulking in the air, in the water, in the bush.", 1
"They must have been dying like flies here.", 1
"Oh, yes—he did it.", 1
"Did it very well, too, no doubt, and without thinking much about it either, except afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his time, perhaps.", 1
"They were men enough to face the darkness.", 1
"And perhaps he was cheered by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet at Ravenna by and by, if he had good friends in Rome and survived the awful climate.", 1
"Or think of a decent young citizen in a toga—perhaps too much dice, you know—coming out here in the train of some prefect, or tax-gatherer, or trader even, to mend his fortunes.", 1
"Land in a swamp, march through the woods, and in some inland post feel the savagery, the utter savagery, had closed round him—all that mysterious life of the wilderness that stirs in the forest, in the jungles, in the hearts of wild men.", 1
"There’s no initiation either into such mysteries.", 1
"He has to live in the midst of the incomprehensible, which is also detestable.", 1
"And it has a fascination, too, that goes to work upon him.", 1
"Ibarra resolves to forego all quarrels and to work for the betterment of his people.", 1
"To show his good intentions, he seeks to establish, at his own expense, a public school in his native town.", 1
"He meets with ostensible support from all, especially Padre Damaso’s successor, a young and gloomy Franciscan named Padre Salvi, for whom Maria Clara confesses to an instinctive dread.", 1
"At the laying of the corner-stone for the new schoolhouse a suspicious accident, apparently aimed at Ibarra’s life, occurs, but the festivities proceed until the dinner, where Ibarra is grossly and wantonly insulted over the memory of his father by Fray Damaso.", 1
"The young man loses control of himself and is about to kill the friar, who is saved by the intervention of Maria Clara.", 1
"Ibarra is excommunicated, and Capitan Tiago, through his fear of the friars, is forced to break the engagement and agree to the marriage of Maria Clara with a young and inoffensive Spaniard provided by Padre Damaso.", 1
"Ibarra succeeds in having the excommunication removed, but before he can explain matters an uprising against the Civil Guard is secretly brought about through agents of Padre Salvi, and the leadership is ascribed to Ibarra to ruin him.", 1
"He is warned by a mysterious friend, an outlaw called Elias, whose life he had accidentally saved; but desiring first to see Maria Clara, he refuses to make his escape, and when the outbreak occurs he is arrested as the instigator of it and thrown into prison in Manila.", 1
"On the evening when Capitan Tiago gives a ball in his Manila house to celebrate his supposed daughter’s engagement, Ibarra makes his escape from prison and succeeds in seeing Maria Clara alone.", 1
"The letter had been secured from her by false representations and in exchange for two others written by her mother just before her birth, which prove that Padre Damaso is her real father.", 1
"She tells him that she will marry the young Spaniard, sacrificing herself thus to save her mother’s name and Capitan Tiago’s honor and to prevent a public scandal, but that she will always remain true to him.", 1
"Ibarra’s escape had been effected by Elias, who conveys him in a banka up the Pasig to the Lake, where they are so closely beset by the Civil Guard that Elias leaps into the water and draws the pursuers away from the boat, in which Ibarra lies concealed.", 1
"On Christmas Eve, at the tomb of the Ibarras in a gloomy wood, Elias appears, wounded and dying, to find there a boy named Basilio beside the corpse of his mother, a poor woman who had been driven to insanity by her husband’s neglect and abuses on the part of the Civil Guard, her younger son having disappeared some time before in the convento, where he was a sacristan.", 1
"Basilio, who is ignorant of Elias’s identity, helps him to build a funeral pyre, on which his corpse and the madwoman’s are to be burned.", 1
"Upon learning of the reported death of Ibarra in the chase on the Lake, Maria Clara becomes disconsolate and begs her supposed godfather, Fray Damaso, to put her in a nunnery.", 1
"Unconscious of her knowledge of their true relationship, the friar breaks down and confesses that all the trouble he has stirred up with the Ibarras has been to prevent her from marrying a native, which would condemn her and her children to the oppressed and enslaved class.", 1
"He finally yields to her entreaties and she enters the nunnery of St. Clara, to which Padre Salvi is soon assigned in a ministerial capacity.", 1
"One morning in December the steamer Tabo was laboriously ascending the tortuous course of the Pasig, carrying a large crowd of passengers toward the province of La Laguna.", 1
"She was a heavily built steamer, almost round, like the tabú from which she derived her name, quite dirty in spite of her pretensions to whiteness, majestic and grave from her leisurely motion.", 1
"Altogether, she was held in great affection in that region, perhaps from her Tagalog name, or from the fact that she bore the characteristic impress of things in the country, representing something like a triumph over progress, a steamer that was not a steamer at all, an organism, stolid, imperfect yet unimpeachable, which, when it wished to pose as being rankly progressive, proudly contented itself with putting on a fresh coat of paint.", 3
"Indeed, the happy steamer was genuinely Filipino!", 3
"If a person were only reasonably considerate, she might even have been taken for the Ship of State, constructed, as she had been, under the inspection of Reverendos and Ilustrísimos....", 3
"Bathed in the sunlight of a morning that made the waters of the river sparkle and the breezes rustle in the bending bamboo on its banks, there she goes with her white silhouette throwing out great clouds of smoke—the Ship of State, so the joke runs, also has the vice of smoking!", 3
"The whistle shrieks at every moment, hoarse and commanding like a tyrant who would rule by shouting, so that no one on board can hear his own thoughts.", 1
"She menaces everything she meets: now she looks as though she would grind to bits the salambaw, insecure fishing apparatus which in their movements resemble skeletons of giants saluting an antediluvian tortoise; now she speeds straight toward the clumps of bamboo or against the amphibian structures, karihan, or wayside lunch-stands, which, amid gumamelas and other flowers, look like indecisive bathers who with their feet already in the water cannot bring themselves to make the final plunge; at times, following a sort of channel marked out in the river by tree-trunks, she moves along with a satisfied air, except when a sudden shock disturbs the passengers and throws them off their balance, all the result of a collision with a sand-bar which no one dreamed was there.", 1
"Moreover, if the comparison with the Ship of State is not yet complete, note the arrangement of the passengers.", 3
"On the lower deck appear brown faces and black heads, types of Indians, [1] Chinese, and mestizos, wedged in between bales of merchandise and boxes, while there on the upper deck, beneath an awning that protects them from the sun, are seated in comfortable chairs a few passengers dressed in the fashion of Europeans, friars, and government clerks, each with his puro cigar, and gazing at the landscape apparently without heeding the efforts of the captain and the sailors to overcome the obstacles in the river.", 1
"The captain was a man of kindly aspect, well along in years, an old sailor who in his youth had plunged into far vaster seas, but who now in his age had to exercise much greater attention, care, and vigilance to avoid dangers of a trivial character.", 1
"And they were the same for each day: the same sand-bars, the same hulk of unwieldy steamer wedged into the same curves, like a corpulent dame in a jammed throng.", 1
"So, at each moment, the good man had to stop, to back up, to go forward at half speed, sending—now to port, now to starboard—the five sailors equipped with long bamboo poles to give force to the turn the rudder had suggested.", 1
"He was like a veteran who, after leading men through hazardous campaigns, had in his age become the tutor of a capricious, disobedient, and lazy boy.", 1
"Seen under these circumstances the Ship of State might be said to have been converted from a tortoise into a crab every time any danger threatened.", 3
"“But, captain, why don’t your stupid steersmen go in that direction?” asked the lady with great indignation.", 1
"“Because it’s very shallow in the other, señora,” answered the captain, deliberately, slowly winking one eye, a little habit which he had cultivated as if to say to his words on their way out, “Slowly, slowly!”", 1
"“Half speed! Botheration, half speed!” protested Doña Victorina disdainfully.", 1
"“Why not full?”", 3
"“Because we should then be traveling over those ricefields, señora,” replied the imperturbable captain, pursing his lips to indicate the cultivated fields and indulging in two circumspect winks.", 1
"This Doña Victorina was well known in the country for her caprices and extravagances.", 1
"She was often seen in society, where she was tolerated whenever she appeared in the company of her niece, Paulita Gomez, a very beautiful and wealthy orphan, to whom she was a kind of guardian.", 1
"At a rather advanced age she had married a poor wretch named Don Tiburcio de Espadaña, and at the time we now see her, carried upon herself fifteen years of wedded life, false frizzes, and a half-European costume—for her whole ambition had been to Europeanize herself, with the result that from the ill-omened day of her wedding she had gradually, thanks to her criminal attempts, succeeded in so transforming herself that at the present time Quatrefages and Virchow together could not have told where to classify her among the known races.", 1
"Her husband, who had borne all her impositions with the resignation of a fakir through so many years of married life, at last on one luckless day had had his bad half-hour and administered to her a superb whack with his crutch.", 1
"The surprise of Madam Job at such an inconsistency of character made her insensible to the immediate effects, and only after she had recovered from her astonishment and her husband had fled did she take notice of the pain, then remaining in bed for several days, to the great delight of Paulita, who was very fond of joking and laughing at her aunt.", 1
"She had received a report of his being in the province of La Laguna, concealed in one of the towns, so thither she was bound to seduce him back with her dyed frizzes.", 1
"Her fellow travelers had taken measures of defense by keeping up among themselves a lively conversation on any topic whatsoever.", 1
"At that moment the windings and turnings of the river led them to talk about straightening the channel and, as a matter of course, about the port works.", 1
"Ben-Zayb, the journalist with the countenance of a friar, was disputing with a young friar who in turn had the countenance of an artilleryman.", 1
"The thin Franciscan, understanding the Dominican’s smile, decided to intervene and stop the argument.", 1
"He was undoubtedly respected, for with a wave of his hand he cut short the speech of both at the moment when the friar-artilleryman was talking about experience and the journalist-friar about scientists.", 1
"Padre Salvi, the thin and withered cleric, appeared to be satisfied with such submissiveness and went on in the midst of the silence: “But this does not mean that you may not be as near right as Padre Camorra” (the friar-artilleryman).", 1
"“The fact is there isn’t a single decent lake in this country,” interrupted Doña Victorina, highly indignant, and getting ready for a return to the assault upon the citadel.", 1
"The besieged gazed at one another in terror, but with the promptitude of a general, the jeweler Simoun rushed in to the rescue.", 1
"“The remedy is very simple,” he said in a strange accent, a mixture of English and South American.", 1
"All turned to give him careful attention, even the Dominican.", 1
"The jeweler was a tall, meager, nervous man, very dark, dressed in the English fashion and wearing a pith helmet.", 1
"Remarkable about him was his long white hair contrasted with a sparse black beard, indicating a mestizo origin.", 1
"To avoid the glare of the sun he wore constantly a pair of enormous blue goggles, which completely hid his eyes and a portion of his cheeks, thus giving him the aspect of a blind or weak-sighted person.", 1
"He was standing with his legs apart as if to maintain his balance, with his hands thrust into the pockets of his coat.", 1
"“The remedy is very simple,” he repeated, “and wouldn’t cost a cuarto.”", 1
"The attention now redoubled, for it was whispered in Manila that this man controlled the Captain-General, and all saw the remedy in process of execution.", 1
"Even Don Custodio himself turned to listen.", 1
"“Dig a canal straight from the source to the mouth of the river, passing through Manila; that is, make a new river-channel and fill up the old Pasig.", 1
"That would save land, shorten communication, and prevent the formation of sandbars.”", 1
"The project left all his hearers astounded, accustomed as they were to palliative measures.", 1
"“It’s a Yankee plan!” observed Ben-Zayb, to ingratiate himself with Simoun, who had spent a long time in North America.", 3
"All considered the plan wonderful and so indicated by the movements of their heads.", 1
"Only Don Custodio, the liberal Don Custodio, owing to his independent position and his high offices, thought it his duty to attack a project that did not emanate from himself—that was a usurpation!", 3
"He coughed, stroked the ends of his mustache, and with a voice as important as though he were at a formal session of the Ayuntamiento, said, “Excuse me, Señor Simoun, my respected friend, if I should say that I am not of your opinion.", 1
"It would cost a great deal of money and might perhaps destroy some towns.”", 1
"“Then destroy them!” rejoined Simoun coldly.", 1
"“And the money to pay the laborers?”", 1
"“Don’t pay them! Use the prisoners and convicts!”", 1
"“But there aren’t enough, Señor Simoun!”", 1
"The startled Don Custodio turned his head to see if there was any Indian within ear-shot, but fortunately those nearby were rustics, and the two helmsmen seemed to be very much occupied with the windings of the river.", 1
"“But, Señor Simoun—”", 1
"“Don’t fool yourself, Don Custodio,” continued Simoun dryly, “only in this way are great enterprises carried out with small means.", 1
"Thus were constructed the Pyramids, Lake Moeris, and the Colosseum in Rome.", 1
"“Uprisings, ha, ha! Did the Egyptian people ever rebel, I wonder?", 3
"Did the Jewish prisoners rebel against the pious Titus?", 3
"Man, I thought you were better informed in history!”", 3
"So it seemed, for Don Custodio forgot himself and retorted, “But the fact is that you’re not among Egyptians or Jews!”", 1
"“And these people have rebelled more than once,” added the Dominican, somewhat timidly.", 1
"Padre Salvi gave a nod and looked up, evading the question.", 1
"“Well, didn’t you tell me that both buildings were constructed by forcing the people to work on them under the whip of a lay-brother?", 1
"Perhaps that wonderful bridge was built in the same way.", 1
"Now tell me, did these people rebel?”", 1
"“The fact is—they have rebelled before,” replied the Dominican, “and ab actu ad posse valet illatio!”", 1
"“No, no, nothing of the kind,” continued Simoun, starting down a hatchway to the cabin.", 1
"“What’s said, is said!", 3
"And you, Padre Sibyla, don’t talk either Latin or nonsense.", 3
"What are you friars good for if the people can rebel?”", 3
"Taking no notice of the replies and protests, Simoun descended the small companionway that led below, repeating disdainfully, “Bosh, bosh!”", 1
"Padre Sibyla turned pale; this was the first time that he, Vice-Rector of the University, had ever been credited with nonsense.", 1
"Don Custodio turned green; at no meeting in which he had ever found himself had he encountered such an adversary.", 1
"“An American mulatto!” he fumed.", 1
"“A British Indian,” observed Ben-Zayb in a low tone.", 1
"No one dared to join in this diatribe.", 1
"Don Custodio could discredit himself with his Excellency, if he wished, but neither Ben-Zayb, nor Padre Irene, nor Padre Salvi, nor the offended Padre Sibyla had any confidence in the discretion of the others.", 3
"The Canon Irene indulged in a rather equivocal smile, which he half hid with his hand as he rubbed his nose.", 3
"“I tell you, Ben-Zayb,” continued Don Custodio, slapping the journalist on the arm, “all the trouble comes from not consulting the old-timers here.", 1
"“There’s something in that, there’s something in that,” Ben-Zayb thought it his duty to remark, since in his capacity of journalist he had to be informed about everything.", 3
"Here Don Custodio extended his arms and gazed triumphantly at the stupefaction of his hearers—to none of them had occurred such an original idea.", 1
"“Will you allow me to write an article about that?” asked Ben-Zayb.", 1
"“But, Don Custodio,” exclaimed Doña Victorina with smirks and grimaces, “if everybody takes to raising ducks the balot [5] eggs will become abundant.", 1
"Ugh, how nasty!", 1
"Rather, let the bar close up entirely!”", 1
"There, below, other scenes were being enacted.", 1
"Some were silently gazing at the changing scenes along the banks, others were playing cards or conversing in the midst of the scraping of shovels, the roar of the engine, the hiss of escaping steam, the swash of disturbed waters, and the shrieks of the whistle.", 1
"Nevertheless, two of them, instead of engaging in these fleeting gallantries, stood in the bow talking with a man, advanced in years, but still vigorous and erect.", 1
"Both these youths seemed to be well known and respected, to judge from the deference shown them by their fellow passengers.", 1
"The elder, who was dressed in complete black, was the medical student, Basilio, famous for his successful cures and extraordinary treatments, while the other, taller and more robust, although much younger, was Isagani, one of the poets, or at least rimesters, who that year came from the Ateneo, [6] a curious character, ordinarily quite taciturn and uncommunicative.", 1
"The man talking with them was the rich Capitan Basilio, who was returning from a business trip to Manila.", 1
"“Capitan Tiago is getting along about the same as usual, yes, sir,” said the student Basilio, shaking his head.", 1
"“He won’t submit to any treatment.", 1
"When the student said a certain person, he really meant Padre Irene, a great friend and adviser of Capitan Tiago in his last days.", 1
"“Opium is one of the plagues of modern times,” replied the capitan with the disdain and indignation of a Roman senator.", 1
"“The ancients knew about it but never abused it.", 1
"Isagani regarded him with attention: that gentleman was suffering from nostalgia for antiquity.", 1
"“But to get back to this academy of Castilian,” Capitan Basilio continued, “I assure you, gentlemen, that you won’t materialize it.”", 1
"“Yes, sir, from day to day we’re expecting the permit,” replied Isagani.", 1
"“Padre Irene, whom you may have noticed above, and to whom we’ve presented a team of bays, has promised it to us.", 1
"He’s on his way now to confer with the General.”", 1
"“That doesn’t matter. Padre Sibyla is opposed to it.”", 1
"“Let him oppose it!", 1
"That’s why he’s here on the steamer, in order to—at Los Baños before the General.”", 1
"And the student Basilio filled out his meaning by going through the pantomime of striking his fists together.", 1
"“That’s understood,” observed Capitan Basilio, smiling.", 1
"“But even though you get the permit, where’ll you get the funds?”", 1
"“We have them, sir. Each student has contributed a real.”", 1
"“But what about the professors?”", 1
"“We have them: half Filipinos and half Peninsulars.”", 1
"“And the house?”", 1
"“Makaraig, the wealthy Makaraig, has offered one of his.”", 1
"Capitan Basilio had to give in; these young men had everything arranged.", 1
"The youths smiled at each other.", 1
"“These men of the past,” remarked Isagani, “find obstacles for everything.", 1
"“He’s right at home with your uncle,” observed Basilio.", 1
"Isagani blushed.", 1
"“Naturally! But the fact is that her husband is actually hidden—in my uncle’s house!”", 1
"At that moment Simoun came down and, catching sight of the two young men, greeted Basilio in a patronizing tone: “Hello, Don Basilio, you’re off for the vacation?", 1
"Is the gentleman a townsman of yours?”", 1
"Basilio introduced Isagani with the remark that he was not a townsman, but that their homes were not very far apart.", 1
"Isagani lived on the seashore of the opposite coast.", 1
"Simoun examined him with such marked attention that he was annoyed, turned squarely around, and faced the jeweler with a provoking stare.", 1
"“Well, what is the province like?” the latter asked, turning again to Basilio.", 1
"“Why, aren’t you familiar with it?”", 1
"“We don’t buy jewels, because we don’t need them,” rejoined Isagani dryly, piqued in his provincial pride.", 1
"A smile played over Simoun’s pallid lips.", 1
"“Don’t be offended, young man,” he replied.", 1
"The youths thanked him, but declined the offer.", 1
"“You do wrong,” Simoun said to them, visibly taken aback.", 1
"Isagani was almost as tall as the jeweler, and at this he drew himself up.", 1
"Simoun raised his head.", 1
"Although his looks could not be read through the blue goggles, on the rest of his face surprise might be seen.", 1
"“Rather a good answer,” he said.", 1
"“No, Señor Simoun,” interposed Basilio, changing to a jesting tone, “rather keep in mind the verses of my friend Isagani himself:", 1
"“Utopia, Utopia!” responded Simoun dryly.", 3
"“The engine is about to meet—in the meantime, I’ll drink my beer.”", 1
"So, without any word of excuse, he left the two friends.", 1
"“But what’s the matter with you today that you’re so quarrelsome?” asked Basilio.", 1
"“Nothing. I don’t know why, but that man fills me with horror, fear almost.”", 1
"“I was nudging you with my elbow.", 1
"Don’t you know that he’s called the Brown Cardinal?”", 1
"“The Brown Cardinal?”", 1
"“Or Black Eminence, as you wish.”", 1
"“I don’t understand.”", 1
"“That’s what I’ve heard from a certain person,—who always speaks ill of him behind his back and flatters him to his face.”", 3
"“Does he also visit Capitan Tiago?”", 1
"At that moment Isagani was called away by a servant to his uncle.", 1
"On one of the benches at the stern, huddled in among the other passengers, sat a native priest gazing at the landscapes that were successively unfolded to his view.", 1
"His neighbors made room for him, the men on passing taking off their hats, and the gamblers not daring to set their table near where he was.", 1
"He said little, but neither smoked nor assumed arrogant airs, nor did he disdain to mingle with the other men, returning the salutes with courtesy and affability as if he felt much honored and very grateful.", 1
"Although advanced in years, with hair almost completely gray, he appeared to be in vigorous health, and even when seated held his body straight and his head erect, but without pride or arrogance.", 1
"He differed from the ordinary native priests, few enough indeed, who at that period served merely as coadjutors or administered some curacies temporarily, in a certain self-possession and gravity, like one who was conscious of his personal dignity and the sacredness of his office.", 1
"This priest was Padre Florentino, Isagani’s uncle, and his story is easily told.", 1
"But in that struggle Florentine received a wound from which he never recovered.", 1
"Weeks before his first mass the woman he loved, in desperation, married a nobody—a blow the rudest he had ever experienced.", 1
"He lost his moral energy, life became dull and insupportable.", 1
"If not his virtue and the respect for his office, that unfortunate love affair saved him from the depths into which the regular orders and secular clergymen both fall in the Philippines.", 1
"He devoted himself to his parishioners as a duty, and by inclination to the natural sciences.", 1
"The captain of the steamer caught sight of the old priest and insisted that he go to the upper deck, saying, “If you don’t do so, the friars will think that you don’t want to associate with them.”", 1
"Padre Florentino had no recourse but to accept, so he summoned his nephew in order to let him know where he was going, and to charge him not to come near the upper deck while he was there.", 1
"“If the captain notices you, he’ll invite you also, and we should then be abusing his kindness.”", 1
"“My uncle’s way!” thought Isagani.", 3
"“All so that I won’t have any reason for talking with Doña Victorina.”", 3
"When Padre Florentino joined the group above, the bad humor provoked by the previous discussion had entirely disappeared.", 1
"Perhaps their spirits had been raised by the attractive houses of the town of Pasig, or the glasses of sherry they had drunk in preparation for the coming meal, or the prospect of a good breakfast.", 1
"Whatever the cause, the fact was that they were all laughing and joking, even including the lean Franciscan, although he made little noise and his smiles looked like death-grins.", 1
"“Evil times, evil times!” said Padre Sibyla with a laugh.", 3
"“Tut, tut!” was the reply; “you don’t see our expenses, and the tenants on our estates are beginning to complain—”", 1
"“Here, enough of complaints, puñales, else I’ll fall to weeping!” cried Padre Camorra gleefully.", 1
"We’re not complaining, and we haven’t either estates or banking-houses.", 1
"You know that my Indians are beginning to haggle over the fees and to flash schedules on me!", 1
"Just look how they cite schedules to me now, and none other than those of the Archbishop Basilio Sancho, [10] as if from his time up to now prices had not risen.", 1
"Why should a baptism cost less than a chicken?", 3
"But I play the deaf man, collect what I can, and never complain.", 1
"We’re not avaricious, are we, Padre Salvi?”", 3
"At that moment Simoun’s head appeared above the hatchway.", 1
"“Well, where’ve you been keeping yourself?” Don Custodio called to him, having forgotten all about their dispute.", 1
"“Pshaw!” retorted Simoun, as he ascended, “I’ve seen so many rivers and landscapes that I’m only interested in those that call up legends.”", 1
"“As for legends, the Pasig has a few,” observed the captain, who did not relish any depreciation of the river where he navigated and earned his livelihood.", 1
"Then you have another legend, that of Doña Jeronima’s cave, which Padre Florentino can relate to you.”", 1
"“Everybody knows that,” remarked Padre Sibyla disdainfully.", 3
"But neither Simoun, nor Ben-Zayb, nor Padre Irene, nor Padre Camorra knew it, so they begged for the story, some in jest and others from genuine curiosity.", 1
"The priest, adopting the tone of burlesque with which some had made their request, began like an old tutor relating a story to children.", 1
"“A beautiful legend!” exclaimed Ben-Zayb.", 1
"“I’m going to write an article about it.", 1
"It’s sentimental!”", 1
"Doña Victorina thought of dwelling in such a cave and was about to say so, when Simoun took the floor instead.", 1
"“But what’s your opinion about that, Padre Salvi?” he asked the Franciscan, who seemed to be absorbed in thought.", 1
"There was a start of surprise on Padre Sibyla’s part to notice that Padre Salvi shuddered and looked askance at Simoun.", 1
"“I neither can nor should pass judgment upon the conduct of archbishops,” replied the Franciscan sourly.", 1
"Padre Salvi shrugged his shoulders and calmly responded, “It’s not worth while thinking about what can’t happen.", 1
"But speaking of legends, don’t overlook the most beautiful, since it is the truest: that of the miracle of St. Nicholas, the ruins of whose church you may have noticed.", 1
"I’m going to relate it to Señor Simoun, as he probably hasn’t heard it.", 1
"“Marvelous, a marvelous legend!” exclaimed Ben-Zayb.", 1
"“It’s good for an article—the description of the monster, the terror of the Chinaman, the waters of the river, the bamboo brakes.", 1
"The tone in which the jeweler spoke was so serious, while he rested his forehead on the tip of his forefinger in an attitude of deep meditation, that Padre Camorra responded very gravely, “Who knows, who knows?”", 1
"“Since we’re busy with legends and are now entering the lake,” remarked Padre Sibyla, “the captain must know many—”", 1
"At that moment the steamer crossed the bar and the panorama spread out before their eyes was so truly magnificent that all were impressed.", 1
"In front extended the beautiful lake bordered by green shores and blue mountains, like a huge mirror, framed in emeralds and sapphires, reflecting the sky in its glass.", 1
"On the right were spread out the low shores, forming bays with graceful curves, and dim there in the distance the crags of Sungay, while in the background rose Makiling, imposing and majestic, crowned with fleecy clouds.", 1
"On the left lay Talim Island with its curious sweep of hills.", 1
"A fresh breeze rippled over the wide plain of water.", 1
"“By the way, captain,” said Ben-Zayb, turning around, “do you know in what part of the lake a certain Guevara, Navarra, or Ibarra, was killed?”", 1
"The group looked toward the captain, with the exception of Simoun, who had turned away his head as though to look for something on the shore.", 1
"“Ah, yes!” exclaimed Doña Victorina.", 1
"“Where, captain?", 1
"Did he leave any tracks in the water?”", 1
"The good captain winked several times, an indication that he was annoyed, but reading the request in the eyes of all, took a few steps toward the bow and scanned the shore.", 1
"“So that his corpse—” began Ben-Zayb.", 1
"“Went to join his father’s,” replied Padre Sibyla.", 1
"“Wasn’t he also another filibuster, Padre Salvi?”", 1
"“That’s what might be called cheap funerals, Padre Camorra, eh?” remarked Ben-Zayb.", 3
"“I’ve always said that those who won’t pay for expensive funerals are filibusters,” rejoined the person addressed, with a merry laugh.", 3
"“But what’s the matter with you, Señor Simoun?” inquired Ben-Zayb, seeing that the jeweler was motionless and thoughtful.", 1
"Are you seasick—an old traveler like you?", 3
"On such a drop of water as this!”", 3
"“I want to tell you,” broke in the captain, who had come to hold all those places in great affection, “that you can’t call this a drop of water.", 1
"It’s larger than any lake in Switzerland and all those in Spain put together.", 1
"I’ve seen old sailors who got seasick here.”", 1
"Those who have read the first part of this story will perhaps remember an old wood-cutter who lived in the depths of the forest.", 1
"Tandang Selo is still alive, and though his hair has turned completely white, he yet preserves his good health.", 1
"He no longer hunts or cuts firewood, for his fortunes have improved and he works only at making brooms.", 1
"His son Tales (abbreviation of Telesforo) had worked at first on shares on the lands of a capitalist, but later, having become the owner of two carabaos and several hundred pesos, determined to work on his own account, aided by his father, his wife, and his three children.", 1
"So they cut down and cleared away some thick woods which were situated on the borders of the town and which they believed belonged to no one.", 1
"During the labors of cleaning and cultivating the new land, the whole family fell ill with malaria and the mother died, along with the eldest daughter, Lucia, in the flower of her age.", 1
"This, which was the natural consequence of breaking up new soil infested with various kinds of bacteria, they attributed to the anger of the woodland spirit, so they were resigned and went on with their labor, believing him pacified.", 3
"But when they began to harvest their first crop a religious corporation, which owned land in the neighboring town, laid claim to the fields, alleging that they fell within their boundaries, and to prove it they at once started to set up their marks.", 1
"However, the administrator of the religious order left to them, for humanity’s sake, the usufruct of the land on condition that they pay a small sum annually—a mere bagatelle, twenty or thirty pesos.", 3
"Tales, as peaceful a man as could be found, was as much opposed to lawsuits as any one and more submissive to the friars than most people; so, in order not to smash a palyok against a kawali (as he said, for to him the friars were iron pots and he a clay jar), he had the weakness to yield to their claim, remembering that he did not know Spanish and had no money to pay lawyers.", 1
"The harvest was abundant and sold well, so Tales planned to build a wooden house in the barrio of Sagpang, of the town of Tiani, which adjoined San Diego.", 1
"Another year passed, bringing another good crop, and for this reason the friars raised the rent to fifty pesos, which Tales paid in order not to quarrel and because he expected to sell his sugar at a good price.", 1
"That year he at last saw his dream realized: to live in the barrio of Sagpang in a wooden house.", 1
"The father and grandfather then thought of providing some education for the two children, especially the daughter Juliana, or Juli, as they called her, for she gave promise of being accomplished and beautiful.", 1
"A boy who was a friend of the family, Basilio, was studying in Manila, and he was of as lowly origin as they.", 1
"But this dream seemed destined not to be realized.", 1
"The first care the community took when they saw the family prospering was to appoint as cabeza de barangay its most industrious member, which left only Tano, the son, who was only fourteen years old.", 1
"The father was therefore called Cabesang Tales and had to order a sack coat, buy a felt hat, and prepare to spend his money.", 1
"In order to avoid any quarrel with the curate or the government, he settled from his own pocket the shortages in the tax-lists, paying for those who had died or moved away, and he lost considerable time in making the collections and on his trips to the capital.", 1
"“Next year you’ll put on a long skirt and go to Manila to study like the young ladies of the town,” Cabesang Tales told his daughter every time he heard her talking of Basilio’s progress.", 1
"But that next year did not come, and in its stead there was another increase in the rent.", 1
"Cabesang Tales became serious and scratched his head.", 1
"The clay jar was giving up all its rice to the iron pot.", 3
"When the rent had risen to two hundred pesos, Tales was not content with scratching his head and sighing; he murmured and protested.", 1
"The friar-administrator then told him that if he could not pay, some one else would be assigned to cultivate that land—many who desired it had offered themselves.", 1
"He thought at first that the friar was joking, but the friar was talking seriously, and indicated a servant of his to take possession of the land.", 1
"Poor Tales turned pale, he felt a buzzing in his ears, he saw in the red mist that rose before his eyes his wife and daughter, pallid, emaciated, dying, victims of the intermittent fevers—then he saw the thick forest converted into productive fields, he saw the stream of sweat watering its furrows, he saw himself plowing under the hot sun, bruising his feet against the stones and roots, while this friar had been driving about in his carriage with the wretch who was to get the land following like a slave behind his master.", 1
"No, a thousand times, no!", 1
"Who was this intruder that he should have any right to his land?", 3
"Had he brought from his own country a single handful of that soil?", 3
"Had he crooked a single one of his fingers to pull up the roots that ran through it?", 3
"Exasperated by the threats of the friar, who tried to uphold his authority at any cost in the presence of the other tenants, Cabesang Tales rebelled and refused to pay a single cuarto, having ever before himself that red mist, saying that he would give up his fields to the first man who could irrigate it with blood drawn from his own veins.", 1
"Old Selo, on looking at his son’s face, did not dare to mention the cayman, but tried to calm him by talking of clay jars, reminding him that the winner in a lawsuit was left without a shirt to his back.", 1
"“We shall all be turned to clay, father, and without shirts we were born,” was the reply.", 1
"So he resolutely refused to pay or to give up a single span of his land unless the friars should first prove the legality of their claim by exhibiting a title-deed of some kind.", 1
"As they had none, a lawsuit followed, and Cabesang Tales entered into it, confiding that some at least, if not all, were lovers of justice and respecters of the law.", 1
"“I serve and have been serving the King with my money and my services,” he said to those who remonstrated with him.", 1
"“I’m asking for justice and he is obliged to give it to me.”", 1
"Drawn on by fatality, and as if he had put into play in the lawsuit the whole future of himself and his children, he went on spending his savings to pay lawyers, notaries, and solicitors, not to mention the officials and clerks who exploited his ignorance and his needs.", 1
"He moved to and fro between the village and the capital, passed his days without eating and his nights without sleeping, while his talk was always about briefs, exhibits, and appeals.", 1
"There was then seen a struggle such as was never before carried on under the skies of the Philippines: that of a poor Indian, ignorant and friendless, confiding in the justness and righteousness of his cause, fighting against a powerful corporation before which Justice bowed her head, while the judges let fall the scales and surrendered the sword.", 1
"He fought as tenaciously as the ant which bites when it knows that it is going to be crushed, as does the fly which looks into space only through a pane of glass.", 1
"Yet the clay jar defying the iron pot and smashing itself into a thousand pieces bad in it something impressive—it had the sublimeness of desperation!", 3
"On the days when his journeys left him free he patrolled his fields armed with a shotgun, saying that the tulisanes were hovering around and he had need of defending himself in order not to fall into their hands and thus lose his lawsuit.", 1
"As if to improve his marksmanship, he shot at birds and fruits, even the butterflies, with such accurate aim that the friar-administrator did not dare to go to Sagpang without an escort of civil-guards, while the friar’s hireling, who gazed from afar at the threatening figure of Tales wandering over the fields like a sentinel upon the walls, was terror stricken and refused to take the property away from him.", 1
"But the local judges and those at the capital, warned by the experience of one of their number who had been summarily dismissed, dared not give him the decision, fearing their own dismissal.", 1
"Yet they were not really bad men, those judges, they were upright and conscientious, good citizens, excellent fathers, dutiful sons—and they were able to appreciate poor Tales’ situation better than Tales himself could.", 1
"Many of them were versed in the scientific and historical basis of property, they knew that the friars by their own statutes could not own property, but they also knew that to come from far across the sea with an appointment secured with great difficulty, to undertake the duties of the position with the best intentions, and now to lose it because an Indian fancied that justice had to be done on earth as in heaven—that surely was an idea!", 3
"They had their families and greater needs surely than that Indian: one had a mother to provide for, and what duty is more sacred than that of caring for a mother?", 1
"Another had sisters, all of marriageable age; that other there had many little children who expected their daily bread and who, like fledglings in a nest, would surely die of hunger the day he was out of a job; even the very least of them had there, far away, a wife who would be in distress if the monthly remittance failed.", 1
"All these moral and conscientious judges tried everything in their power in the way of counsel, advising Cabesang Tales to pay the rent demanded.", 1
"But Tales, like all simple souls, once he had seen what was just, went straight toward it.", 1
"He demanded proofs, documents, papers, title-deeds, but the friars had none of these, resting their case on his concessions in the past.", 1
"From this stand no one could draw him, nor were there any threats that could intimidate him.", 1
"In vain Governor M—— made a trip expressly to talk to him and frighten him.", 1
"His reply to it all was: “You may do what you like, Mr. Governor, I’m ignorant and powerless.", 1
"But I’ve cultivated those fields, my wife and daughter died while helping me clear them, and I won’t give them up to any one but him who can do more with them than I’ve done.", 1
"Let him first irrigate them with his blood and bury in them his wife and daughter!”", 1
"The upshot of this obstinacy was that the honorable judges gave the decision to the friars, and everybody laughed at him, saying that lawsuits are not won by justice.", 3
"But Cabesang Tales appealed, loaded his shotgun, and patrolled his fields with deliberation.", 1
"During this period his life seemed to be a wild dream.", 1
"His son, Tano, a youth as tall as his father and as good as his sister, was conscripted, but he let the boy go rather than purchase a substitute.", 1
"“I have to pay the lawyers,” he told his weeping daughter.", 1
"“If I win the case I’ll find a way to get him back, and if I lose it I won’t have any need for sons.”", 1
"So the son went away and nothing more was heard of him except that his hair had been cropped and that he slept under a cart.", 1
"Six months later it was rumored that he had been seen embarking for the Carolines; another report was that he had been seen in the uniform of the Civil Guard.", 1
"The grandfather went many days without speaking to the father, Juli fell sick, but Cabesang Tales did not shed a single tear, although for two days he never left the house, as if he feared the looks of reproach from the whole village or that he would be called the executioner of his son.", 1
"But on the third day he again sallied forth with his shotgun.", 1
"Murderous intentions were attributed to him, and there were well-meaning persons who whispered about that he had been heard to threaten that he would bury the friar-administrator in the furrows of his fields, whereat the friar was frightened at him in earnest.", 1
"As a result of this, there came a decree from the Captain-General forbidding the use of firearms and ordering that they be taken up.", 1
"Cabesang Tales had to hand over his shotgun but he continued his rounds armed with a long bolo.", 1
"“What are you going to do with that bolo when the tulisanes have firearms?” old Selo asked him.", 1
"“I must watch my crops,” was the answer.", 1
"“Every stalk of cane growing there is one of my wife’s bones.”", 1
"The bolo was taken up on the pretext that it was too long.", 1
"He then took his father’s old ax and with it on his shoulder continued his sullen rounds.", 1
"Every time he left the house Tandang Selo and Juli trembled for his life.", 1
"The latter would get up from her loom, go to the window, pray, make vows to the saints, and recite novenas.", 1
"The grandfather was at times unable to finish the handle of a broom and talked of returning to the forest—life in that house was unbearable.", 1
"At last their fears were realized.", 1
"As the fields were some distance from the village, Cabesang Tales, in spite of his ax, fell into the hands of tulisanes who had revolvers and rifles.", 1
"They told him that since he had money to pay judges and lawyers he must have some also for the outcasts and the hunted.", 1
"They therefore demanded a ransom of five hundred pesos through the medium of a rustic, with the warning that if anything happened to their messenger, the captive would pay for it with his life.", 1
"Two days of grace were allowed.", 1
"This news threw the poor family into the wildest terror, which was augmented when they learned that the Civil Guard was going out in pursuit of the bandits.", 1
"In case of an encounter, the first victim would be the captive—this they all knew.", 1
"The old man was paralyzed, while the pale and frightened daughter tried often to talk but could not.", 1
"Still, another thought more terrible, an idea more cruel, roused them from their stupor.", 1
"The rustic sent by the tulisanes said that the band would probably have to move on, and if they were slow in sending the ransom the two days would elapse and Cabesang Tales would have his throat cut.", 1
"This drove those two beings to madness, weak and powerless as they were.", 1
"Tandang Selo got up, sat down, went outside, came back again, knowing not where to go, where to seek aid.", 1
"Juli appealed to her images, counted and recounted her money, but her two hundred pesos did not increase or multiply.", 1
"Soon she dressed herself, gathered together all her jewels, and asked the advice of her grandfather, if she should go to see the gobernadorcillo, the judge, the notary, the lieutenant of the Civil Guard.", 1
"The old man said yes to everything, or when she said no, he too said no.", 1
"At length came the neighbors, their relatives and friends, some poorer than others, in their simplicity magnifying the fears.", 1
"The most active of all was Sister Bali, a great panguinguera, who had been to Manila to practise religious exercises in the nunnery of the Sodality.", 1
"Juli was willing to sell all her jewels, except a locket set with diamonds and emeralds which Basilio had given her, for this locket had a history: a nun, the daughter of Capitan Tiago, had given it to a leper, who, in return for professional treatment, had made a present of it to Basilio.", 1
"So she could not sell it without first consulting him.", 1
"Quickly the shell-combs and earrings were sold, as well as Juli’s rosary, to their richest neighbor, and thus fifty pesos were added, but two hundred and fifty were still lacking.", 1
"The locket might be pawned, but Juli shook her head.", 1
"A neighbor suggested that the house be sold and Tandang Selo approved the idea, satisfied to return to the forest and cut firewood as of old, but Sister Bali observed that this could not be done because the owner was not present.", 1
"Another neighbor was going to ask Sister Bali why then did not she settle a little account with her, but the quick panguinguera suspected this and added at once: “Do you know, Juli, what you can do?", 3
"Borrow two hundred and fifty pesos on the house, payable when the lawsuit is won.”", 1
"This seemed to be the best proposition, so they decided to act upon it that same day.", 1
"Sister Bali offered to accompany her, and together they visited the houses of all the rich folks in Tiani, but no one would accept the proposal.", 1
"The case, they said, was already lost, and to show favors to an enemy of the friars was to expose themselves to their vengeance.", 1
"At last a pious woman took pity on the girl and lent the money on condition that Juli should remain with her as a servant until the debt was paid.", 1
"Juli would not have so very much to do: sew, pray, accompany her to mass, and fast for her now and then.", 1
"The girl accepted with tears in her eyes, received the money, and promised to enter her service on the following day, Christmas.", 1
"When the grandfather heard of that sale he fell to weeping like a child.", 1
"What, that granddaughter whom he had not allowed to walk in the sun lest her skin should be burned, Juli, she of the delicate fingers and rosy feet!", 1
"What, his only granddaughter, the sole joy of his fading eyes, she whom he had dreamed of seeing dressed in a long skirt, talking Spanish, and holding herself erect waving a painted fan like the daughters of the wealthy—she to become a servant, to be scolded and reprimanded, to ruin her fingers, to sleep anywhere, to rise in any manner whatsoever!", 1
"So the old grandfather wept and talked of hanging or starving himself to death.", 1
"“If you go,” he declared, “I’m going back to the forest and will never set foot in the town.”", 1
"Juli soothed him by saying that it was necessary for her father to return, that the suit would be won, and they could then ransom her from her servitude.", 1
"The night was a sad one.", 1
"Neither of the two could taste a bite and the old man refused to lie down, passing the whole night seated in a corner, silent and motionless.", 1
"Juli on her part tried to sleep, but for a long time could not close her eyes.", 1
"Somewhat relieved about her father’s fate, she now thought of herself and fell to weeping, but stifled her sobs so that the old man might not hear them.", 1
"The next day she would be a servant, and it was the very day Basilio was accustomed to come from Manila with presents for her.", 1
"Henceforward she would have to give up that love; Basilio, who was going to be a doctor, couldn’t marry a pauper.", 1
"This thought consoled her a little and brought on empty dreams.", 1
"Who knows but that a miracle might happen?", 3
"She might find the two hundred and fifty pesos under the image of the Virgin—she had read of many similar miracles.", 1
"The sun might not rise nor morning come, and meanwhile the suit would be won.", 1
"Her father might return, or Basilio put in his appearance, she might find a bag of gold in the garden, the tulisanes would send the bag of gold, the curate, Padre Camorra, who was always teasing her, would come with the tulisanes.", 1
"When the bells began their chimes for the midnight mass and those who preferred a good sleep to fiestas and ceremonies arose grumbling at the noise and movement, Basilio cautiously left the house, took two or three turns through the streets to see that he was not watched or followed, and then made his way by unfrequented paths to the road that led to the ancient wood of the Ibarras, which had been acquired by Capitan Tiago when their property was confiscated and sold.", 1
"As Christmas fell under the waning moon that year, the place was wrapped in darkness.", 1
"The chimes had ceased, and only the tolling sounded through the darkness of the night amid the murmur of the breeze-stirred branches and the measured roar of the waves on the neighboring lake, like the deep respiration of nature sunk in profound sleep.", 1
"Awed by the time and place, the youth moved along with his head down, as if endeavoring to see through the darkness.", 1
"But from time to time he raised it to gaze at the stars through the open spaces between the treetops and went forward parting the bushes or tearing away the lianas that obstructed his path.", 1
"At times he retraced his steps, his foot would get caught among the plants, he stumbled over a projecting root or a fallen log.", 1
"At the end of a half-hour he reached a small brook on the opposite side of which arose a hillock, a black and shapeless mass that in the darkness took on the proportions of a mountain.", 1
"Basilio crossed the brook on the stones that showed black against the shining surface of the water, ascended the hill, and made his way to a small space enclosed by old and crumbling walls.", 1
"He approached the balete tree that rose in the center, huge, mysterious, venerable, formed of roots that extended up and down among the confusedly-interlaced trunks.", 1
"Pausing before a heap of stones he took off his hat and seemed to be praying.", 1
"There his mother was buried, and every time he came to the town his first visit was to that neglected and unknown grave.", 1
"Since he must visit Cabesang Tales’ family the next day, he had taken advantage of the night to perform this duty.", 1
"Seated on a stone, he seemed to fall into deep thought.", 1
"His past rose before him like a long black film, rosy at first, then shadowy with spots of blood, then black, black, gray, and then light, ever lighter.", 1
"The end could not be seen, hidden as it was by a cloud through which shone lights and the hues of dawn.", 1
"Thirteen years before to the day, almost to the hour, his mother had died there in the deepest distress, on a glorious night when the moon shone brightly and the Christians of the world were engaged in rejoicing.", 1
"Wounded and limping, he had reached there in pursuit of her—she mad and terrified, fleeing from her son as from a ghost.", 1
"There she had died, and there had come a stranger who had commanded him to build a funeral pyre.", 1
"He had obeyed mechanically and when he returned he found a second stranger by the side of the other’s corpse.", 1
"What a night and what a morning those were!", 1
"The stranger helped him raise the pyre, whereon they burned the corpse of the first, dug the grave in which they buried his mother, and then after giving him some pieces of money told him to leave the place.", 1
"It was the first time that he had seen that man—tall, with blood-shot eyes, pale lips, and a sharp nose.", 1
"Entirely alone in the world, without parents or brothers and sisters, he left the town whose authorities inspired in him such great fear and went to Manila to work in some rich house and study at the same time, as many do.", 1
"His journey was an Odyssey of sleeplessness and startling surprises, in which hunger counted for little, for he ate the fruits in the woods, whither he retreated whenever he made out from afar the uniform of the Civil Guard, a sight that recalled the origin of all his misfortunes.", 1
"Once in Manila, ragged and sick, he went from door to door offering his services.", 1
"A boy from the provinces who knew not a single word of Spanish, and sickly besides!", 1
"Discouraged, hungry, and miserable, he wandered about the streets, attracting attention by the wretchedness of his clothing.", 1
"Fortunately, he saw Capitan Tiago, accompanied by Aunt Isabel.", 1
"He had known them since the days in San Diego, and in his joy believed that in them he saw almost fellow-townsfolk.", 1
"He followed the carriage until he lost sight of it, and then made inquiries for the house.", 1
"As it was the very day that Maria Clara entered the nunnery and Capitan Tiago was accordingly depressed, he was admitted as a servant, without pay, but instead with leave to study, if he so wished, in San Juan de Letran.", 1
"Dirty, poorly dressed, with only a pair of clogs for footwear, at the end of several months’ stay in Manila, he entered the first year of Latin.", 1
"On seeing his clothes, his classmates drew away from him, and the professor, a handsome Dominican, never asked him a question, but frowned every time he looked at him.", 1
"In the eight months that the class continued, the only words that passed between them were his name read from the roll and the daily adsum with which the student responded.", 1
"With what bitterness he left the class each day, and, guessing the reason for the treatment accorded him, what tears sprang into his eyes and what complaints were stifled in his heart!", 1
"How he had wept and sobbed over the grave of his mother, relating to her his hidden sorrows, humiliations, and affronts, when at the approach of Christmas Capitan Tiago had taken him back to San Diego!", 1
"Yet he memorized the lessons without omitting a comma, although he understood scarcely any part of them.", 1
"But at length he became resigned, noticing that among the three or four hundred in his class only about forty merited the honor of being questioned, because they attracted the professor’s attention by their appearance, some prank, comicality, or other cause.", 1
"Basilio passed the examinations by answering the solitary question asked him, like a machine, without stopping or breathing, and in the amusement of the examiners won the passing certificate.", 1
"His nine companions—they were examined in batches of ten in order to save time—did not have such good luck, but were condemned to repeat the year of brutalization.", 1
"In the second year the game-cock that he tended won a large sum and he received from Capitan Tiago a big tip, which he immediately invested in the purchase of shoes and a felt hat.", 1
"With these and the clothes given him by his employer, which he made over to fit his person, his appearance became more decent, but did not get beyond that.", 1
"In such a large class a great deal was needed to attract the professor’s attention, and the student who in the first year did not make himself known by some special quality, or did not capture the good-will of the professors, could with difficulty make himself known in the rest of his school-days.", 1
"But Basilio kept on, for perseverance was his chief trait.", 1
"His fortune seemed to change somewhat when he entered the third year.", 1
"His professor happened to be a very jolly fellow, fond of jokes and of making the students laugh, complacent enough in that he almost always had his favorites recite the lessons—in fact, he was satisfied with anything.", 1
"At this time Basilio now wore shoes and a clean and well-ironed camisa.", 1
"As his professor noticed that he laughed very little at the jokes and that his large eyes seemed to be asking something like an eternal question, he took him for a fool, and one day decided to make him conspicuous by calling on him for the lesson.", 1
"Basilio recited it from beginning to end, without hesitating over a single letter, so the professor called him a parrot and told a story to make the class laugh.", 1
"Then to increase the hilarity and justify the epithet he asked several questions, at the same time winking to his favorites, as if to say to them, “You’ll see how we’re going to amuse ourselves.”", 3
"Basilio now understood Spanish and answered the questions with the plain intention of making no one laugh.", 1
"This disgusted everybody, the expected absurdity did not materialize, no one could laugh, and the good friar never pardoned him for having defrauded the hopes of the class and disappointed his own prophecies.", 1
"Why should he be, when he made no one laugh?", 3
"Quite discouraged and thinking of abandoning his studies, he passed to the fourth year of Latin.", 1
"One of the two professors was very popular, beloved by all, passing for a sage, a great poet, and a man of advanced ideas.", 1
"One day when he accompanied the collegians on their walk, he had a dispute with some cadets, which resulted in a skirmish and a challenge.", 1
"No doubt recalling his brilliant youth, the professor preached a crusade and promised good marks to all who during the promenade on the following Sunday would take part in the fray.", 3
"The week was a lively one—there were occasional encounters in which canes and sabers were crossed, and in one of these Basilio distinguished himself.", 1
"Borne in triumph by the students and presented to the professor, he thus became known to him and came to be his favorite.", 1
"Partly for this reason and partly from his diligence, that year he received the highest marks, medals included, in view of which Capitan Tiago, who, since his daughter had become a nun, exhibited some aversion to the friars, in a fit of good humor induced him to transfer to the Ateneo Municipal, the fame of which was then in its apogee.", 1
"Here a new world opened before his eyes—a system of instruction that he had never dreamed of.", 1
"Except for a few superfluities and some childish things, he was filled with admiration for the methods there used and with gratitude for the zeal of the instructors.", 1
"His eyes at times filled with tears when he thought of the four previous years during which, from lack of means, he had been unable to study at that center.", 1
"He had to make extraordinary efforts to get himself to the level of those who had had a good preparatory course, and it might be said that in that one year he learned the whole five of the secondary curricula.", 1
"He received his bachelor’s degree, to the great satisfaction of his instructors, who in the examinations showed themselves to be proud of him before the Dominican examiners sent there to inspect the school.", 1
"“In San Juan de Letran, Padre,” answered Basilio.", 1
"From choice and temperament he selected the course in medicine.", 1
"With equal diligence, or more if possible, the young man continued this course, and after the third year began to render medical services with such great success that he was not only preparing a brilliant future for himself but also earning enough to dress well and save some money.", 1
"This was the last year of the course and in two months he would be a physician; he would come back to the town, he would marry Juliana, and they would be happy.", 1
"The granting of his licentiateship was not only assured, but he expected it to be the crowning act of his school-days, for he had been designated to deliver the valedictory at the graduation, and already he saw himself in the rostrum, before the whole faculty, the object of public attention.", 1
"All those heads, leaders of Manila science, half-hidden in their colored capes; all the women who came there out of curiosity and who years before had gazed at him, if not with disdain, at least with indifference; all those men whose carriages had once been about to crush him down in the mud like a dog: they would listen attentively, and he was going to say something to them that would not be trivial, something that had never before resounded in that place, he was going to forget himself in order to aid the poor students of the future—and he would make his entrance on his work in the world with that speech.", 1
"Over these matters Basilio was pondering as he visited his mother’s grave.", 1
"He was about to start back to the town when he thought he saw a light flickering among the trees and heard the snapping of twigs, the sound of feet, and rustling of leaves.", 1
"The light disappeared but the noises became more distinct, coming directly toward where he was.", 1
"Basilio was not naturally superstitious, especially after having carved up so many corpses and watched beside so many death-beds, but the old legends about that ghostly spot, the hour, the darkness, the melancholy sighing of the wind, and certain tales heard in his childhood, asserted their influence over his mind and made his heart beat violently.", 1
"The figure stopped on the other side of the balete, but the youth could see it through an open space between two roots that had grown in the course of time to the proportions of tree-trunks.", 1
"It produced from under its coat a lantern with a powerful reflecting lens, which it placed on the ground, thereby lighting up a pair of riding-boots, the rest of the figure remaining concealed in the darkness.", 1
"The figure seemed to search its pockets and then bent over to fix a shovel-blade on the end of a stout cane.", 1
"To his great surprise Basilio thought he could make out some of the features of the jeweler Simoun, who indeed it was.", 1
"The jeweler dug in the ground and from time to time the lantern illuminated his face, on which were not now the blue goggles that so completely disguised him.", 1
"Basilio shuddered: that was the same stranger who thirteen years before had dug his mother’s grave there, only now he had aged somewhat, his hair had turned white, he wore a beard and a mustache, but yet his look was the same, the bitter expression, the same cloud on his brow, the same muscular arms, though somewhat thinner now, the same violent energy.", 1
"Old impressions were stirred in the boy: he seemed to feel the heat of the fire, the hunger, the weariness of that time, the smell of freshly turned earth.", 1
"Yet his discovery terrified him—that jeweler Simoun, who passed for a British Indian, a Portuguese, an American, a mulatto, the Brown Cardinal, his Black Eminence, the evil genius of the Captain-General as many called him, was no other than the mysterious stranger whose appearance and disappearance coincided with the death of the heir to that land!", 1
"But of the two strangers who had appeared, which was Ibarra, the living or the dead?", 3
"This question, which he had often asked himself whenever Ibarra’s death was mentioned, again came into his mind in the presence of the human enigma he now saw before him.", 1
"The dead man had had two wounds, which must have been made by firearms, as he knew from what he had since studied, and which would be the result of the chase on the lake.", 1
"Then the dead man must have been Ibarra, who had come to die at the tomb of his forefathers, his desire to be cremated being explained by his residence in Europe, where cremation is practised.", 1
"Then who was the other, the living, this jeweler Simoun, at that time with such an appearance of poverty and wretchedness, but who had now returned loaded with gold and a friend of the authorities?", 1
"There was the mystery, and the student, with his characteristic cold-bloodedness, determined to clear it up at the first opportunity.", 1
"Simoun dug away for some time, but Basilio noticed that his old vigor had declined—he panted and had to rest every few moments.", 1
"Fearing that he might be discovered, the boy made a sudden resolution.", 1
"Rising from his seat and issuing from his hiding-place, he asked in the most matter-of-fact tone, “Can I help you, sir?”", 1
"Simoun straightened up with the spring of a tiger attacked at his prey, thrust his hand in his coat pocket, and stared at the student with a pale and lowering gaze.", 1
"“Thirteen years ago you rendered me a great service, sir,” went on Basilio unmoved, “in this very place, by burying my mother, and I should consider myself happy if I could serve you now.”", 1
"Without taking his eyes off the youth Simoun drew a revolver from his pocket and the click of a hammer being cocked was heard.", 1
"“For whom do you take me?” he asked, retreating a few paces.", 1
"“For a person who is sacred to me,” replied Basilio with some emotion, for he thought his last moment had come.", 1
"An impressive silence followed these words, a silence that to the youth seemed to suggest eternity.", 1
"But Simoun, after some hesitation, approached him and placing a hand on his shoulder said in a moving tone: “Basilio, you possess a secret that can ruin me and now you have just surprised me in another, which puts me completely in your hands, the divulging of which would upset all my plans.", 1
"For my own security and for the good of the cause in which I labor, I ought to seal your lips forever, for what is the life of one man compared to the end I seek?", 3
"The occasion is fitting; no one knows that I have come here; I am armed; you are defenceless; your death would be attributed to the outlaws, if not to more supernatural causes—yet I’ll let you live and trust that I shall not regret it.", 3
"You have toiled, you have struggled with energetic perseverance, and like myself, you have your scores to settle with society.", 1
"Your brother was murdered, your mother driven to insanity, and society has prosecuted neither the assassin nor the executioner.", 1
"You and I are the dregs of justice and instead of destroying we ought to aid each other.”", 1
"Simoun paused with a repressed sigh, and then slowly resumed, while his gaze wandered about: “Yes, I am he who came here thirteen years ago, sick and wretched, to pay the last tribute to a great and noble soul that was willing to die for me.", 1
"The victim of a vicious system, I have wandered over the world, working night and day to amass a fortune and carry out my plan.", 1
"Now I have returned to destroy that system, to precipitate its downfall, to hurl it into the abyss toward which it is senselessly rushing, even though I may have to shed oceans of tears and blood.", 1
"It has condemned itself, it stands condemned, and I don’t want to die before I have seen it in fragments at the foot of the precipice!”", 1
"Simoun extended both his arms toward the earth, as if with that gesture he would like to hold there the broken remains.", 1
"His voice took on a sinister, even lugubrious tone, which made the student shudder.", 1
"“Called by the vices of the rulers, I have returned to these islands, and under the cloak of a merchant have visited the towns.", 1
"My gold has opened a way for me and wheresoever I have beheld greed in the most execrable forms, sometimes hypocritical, sometimes shameless, sometimes cruel, fatten on the dead organism, like a vulture on a corpse, I have asked myself—why was there not, festering in its vitals, the corruption, the ptomaine, the poison of the tombs, to kill the foul bird?", 1
"The corpse was letting itself be consumed, the vulture was gorging itself with meat, and because it was not possible for me to give it life so that it might turn against its destroyer, and because the corruption developed slowly, I have stimulated greed, I have abetted it.", 1
"The cases of injustice and the abuses multiplied themselves; I have instigated crime and acts of cruelty, so that the people might become accustomed to the idea of death.", 1
"I have stirred up trouble so that to escape from it some remedy might be found; I have placed obstacles in the way of trade so that the country, impoverished and reduced to misery, might no longer be afraid of anything; I have excited desires to plunder the treasury, and as this has not been enough to bring about a popular uprising, I have wounded the people in their most sensitive fiber; I have made the vulture itself insult the very corpse that it feeds upon and hasten the corruption.", 1
"“Ah, youth is ever inexperienced and dreamy, always running after the butterflies and flowers!", 1
"You have united, so that by your efforts you may bind your fatherland to Spain with garlands of roses when in reality you are forging upon it chains harder than the diamond!", 1
"You ask for equal rights, the Hispanization of your customs, and you don’t see that what you are begging for is suicide, the destruction of your nationality, the annihilation of your fatherland, the consecration of tyranny!", 1
"What will you be in the future?", 3
"A people without character, a nation without liberty—everything you have will be borrowed, even your very defects!", 1
"You beg for Hispanization, and do not pale with shame when they deny it you!", 1
"And even if they should grant it to you, what then—what have you gained?", 3
"At best, a country of pronunciamentos, a land of civil wars, a republic of the greedy and the malcontents, like some of the republics of South America!", 1
"You wish to add one more language to the forty odd that are spoken in the islands, so that you may understand one another less and less.”", 3
"“On the contrary,” replied Basilio, “if the knowledge of Castilian may bind us to the government, in exchange it may also unite the islands among themselves.”", 1
"“A gross error!” rejoined Simoun.", 1
"“You are letting yourselves be deceived by big words and never go to the bottom of things to examine the results in their final analysis.", 1
"Spanish will never be the general language of the country, the people will never talk it, because the conceptions of their brains and the feelings of their hearts cannot be expressed in that language—each people has its own tongue, as it has its own way of thinking!", 1
"What are you going to do with Castilian, the few of you who will speak it?", 3
"Kill off your own originality, subordinate your thoughts to other brains, and instead of freeing yourselves, make yourselves slaves indeed!", 1
"Nine-tenths of those of you who pretend to be enlightened are renegades to your country!", 1
"He among you who talks that language neglects his own in such a way that he neither writes nor understands it, and how many have I not seen who pretended not to know a single word of it!", 1
"But fortunately, you have an imbecile government!", 3
"While Russia enslaves Poland by forcing the Russian language upon it, while Germany prohibits French in the conquered provinces, your government strives to preserve yours, and you in return, a remarkable people under an incredible government, you are trying to despoil yourselves of your own nationality!", 1
"One and all you forget that while a people preserves its language, it preserves the marks of its liberty, as a man preserves his independence while he holds to his own way of thinking.", 1
"Language is the thought of the peoples.", 1
"Luckily, your independence is assured; human passions are looking out for that!”", 3
"Simoun paused and rubbed his hand over his forehead.", 1
"The waning moon was rising and sent its faint light down through the branches of the trees, and with his white locks and severe features, illuminated from below by the lantern, the jeweler appeared to be the fateful spirit of the wood planning some evil.", 1
"Basilio was silent before such bitter reproaches and listened with bowed head, while Simoun resumed: “I saw this movement started and have passed whole nights of anguish, because I understood that among those youths there were exceptional minds and hearts, sacrificing themselves for what they thought to be a good cause, when in reality they were working against their own country.", 1
"How many times have I wished to speak to you young men, to reveal myself and undeceive you!", 1
"But in view of the reputation I enjoy, my words would have been wrongly interpreted and would perhaps have had a counter effect.", 3
"How many times have I not longed to approach your Makaraig, your Isagani!", 1
"Sometimes I thought of their death, I wished to destroy them—”", 1
"Simoun checked himself.", 1
"“Here’s why I let you live, Basilio, and by such imprudence I expose myself to the risk of being some day betrayed by you.", 1
"But you know who I am, you know how much I must have suffered—then believe in me!", 1
"You are not of the common crowd, which sees in the jeweler Simoun the trader who incites the authorities to commit abuses in order that the abused may buy jewels.", 1
"I am the Judge who wishes to castigate this system by making use of its own defects, to make war on it by flattering it.", 1
"I need your help, your influence among the youth, to combat these senseless desires for Hispanization, for assimilation, for equal rights.", 1
"By that road you will become only a poor copy, and the people should look higher.", 1
"It is madness to attempt to influence the thoughts of the rulers—they have their plan outlined, the bandage covers their eyes, and besides losing time uselessly, you are deceiving the people with vain hopes and are helping to bend their necks before the tyrant.", 1
"What you should do is to take advantage of their prejudices to serve your needs.", 1
"Are they unwilling that you be assimilated with the Spanish people?", 3
"Good enough!", 3
"Distinguish yourselves then by revealing yourselves in your own character, try to lay the foundations of the Philippine fatherland!", 1
"Do they deny you hope?", 3
"Good!", 3
"Don’t depend on them, depend upon yourselves and work!", 1
"Do they deny you representation in their Cortes?", 3
"So much the better!", 3
"Even should you succeed in sending representatives of your own choice, what are you going to accomplish there except to be overwhelmed among so many voices, and sanction with your presence the abuses and wrongs that are afterwards perpetrated?", 3
"The fewer rights they allow you, the more reason you will have later to throw off the yoke, and return evil for evil.", 1
"If they are unwilling to teach you their language, cultivate your own, extend it, preserve to the people their own way of thinking, and instead of aspiring to be a province, aspire to be a nation!", 1
"Instead of subordinate thoughts, think independently, to the end that neither by right, nor custom, nor language, the Spaniard can be considered the master here, nor even be looked upon as a part of the country, but ever as an invader, a foreigner, and sooner or later you will have your liberty!", 1
"Here’s why I let you live!”", 1
"Basilio breathed freely, as though a great weight had been lifted from him, and after a brief pause, replied: “Sir, the honor you do me in confiding your plans to me is too great for me not to be frank with you, and tell you that what you ask of me is beyond my power.", 1
"I am no politician, and if I have signed the petition for instruction in Castilian it has been because I saw in it an advantage to our studies and nothing more.", 1
"My destiny is different; my aspiration reduces itself to alleviating the physical sufferings of my fellow men.”", 1
"The jeweler smiled.", 1
"“What are physical sufferings compared to moral tortures?", 3
"What is the death of a man in the presence of the death of a society?", 3
"Some day you will perhaps be a great physician, if they let you go your way in peace, but greater yet will be he who can inject a new idea into this anemic people!", 3
"You, what are you doing for the land that gave you existence, that supports your life, that affords you knowledge?", 3
"Don’t you realize that that is a useless life which is not consecrated to a great idea?", 3
"It is a stone wasted in the fields without becoming a part of any edifice.”", 3
"“No, no, sir!” replied Basilio modestly, “I’m not folding my arms, I’m working like all the rest to raise up from the ruins of the past a people whose units will be bound together—that each one may feel in himself the conscience and the life of the whole.", 1
"But however enthusiastic our generation may be, we understand that in this great social fabric there must be a division of labor.", 1
"I have chosen my task and will devote myself to science.”", 1
"“Science is not the end of man,” declared Simoun.", 1
"“The most civilized nations are tending toward it.”", 1
"“Yes, but only as a means of seeking their welfare.”", 1
"“Science is more eternal, it’s more human, it’s more universal!” exclaimed the youth in a transport of enthusiasm.", 1
"Simoun smiled sadly.", 1
"“Yes, yes,” he said with a shake of his head, “yet to reach that condition it is necessary that there be no tyrannical and no enslaved peoples, it is necessary that man go about freely, that he know how to respect the rights of others in their own individuality, and for this there is yet much blood to be shed, the struggle forces itself forward.", 1
"To overcome the ancient fanaticism that bound consciences it was necessary that many should perish in the holocausts, so that the social conscience in horror declared the individual conscience free.", 1
"It is also necessary that all answer the question which with each day the fatherland asks them, with its fettered hands extended!", 1
"Patriotism can only be a crime in a tyrannical people, because then it is rapine under a beautiful name, but however perfect humanity may become, patriotism will always be a virtue among oppressed peoples, because it will at all times mean love of justice, of liberty, of personal dignity—nothing of chimerical dreams, of effeminate idyls!", 1
"The greatness of a man is not in living before his time, a thing almost impossible, but in understanding its desires, in responding to its needs, and in guiding it on its forward way.", 1
"The geniuses that are commonly believed to have existed before their time, only appear so because those who judge them see from a great distance, or take as representative of the age the line of stragglers!”", 1
"Simoun fell silent.", 1
"Seeing that he could awake no enthusiasm in that unresponsive mind, he turned to another subject and asked with a change of tone: “And what are you doing for the memory of your mother and your brother?", 1
"Is it enough that you come here every year, to weep like a woman over a grave?”", 3
"And he smiled sarcastically.", 1
"The shot hit the mark.", 1
"Basilio changed color and advanced a step.", 1
"“What do you want me to do?” he asked angrily.", 1
"“But what if I should offer you my aid?”", 1
"Basilio shook his head and remained pensive.", 1
"“All the tardy vindications of justice, all the revenge in the world, will not restore a single hair of my mother’s head, or recall a smile to my brother’s lips.", 1
"Let them rest in peace—what should I gain now by avenging them?”", 1
"“Prevent others from suffering what you have suffered, that in the future there be no brothers murdered or mothers driven to madness.", 1
"Resignation is not always a virtue; it is a crime when it encourages tyrants: there are no despots where there are no slaves!", 1
"Man is in his own nature so wicked that he always abuses complaisance.", 1
"I thought as you do, and you know what my fate was.", 1
"Those who caused your misfortunes are watching you day and night, they suspect that you are only biding your time, they take your eagerness to learn, your love of study, your very complaisance, for burning desires for revenge.", 1
"The day they can get rid of you they will do with you as they did with me, and they will not let you grow to manhood, because they fear and hate you!”", 1
"“Hate me? Still hate me after the wrong they have done me?” asked the youth in surprise.", 3
"Simoun burst into a laugh.", 1
"“But if the world is large, if one leaves them to the peaceful enjoyment of power, if I ask only to be allowed to work, to live—”", 1
"“And to rear meek-natured sons to send them afterwards to submit to the yoke,” continued Simoun, cruelly mimicking Basilio’s tone.", 3
"“A fine future you prepare for them, and they have to thank you for a life of humiliation and suffering!", 3
"Good enough, young man!", 3
"When a body is inert, it is useless to galvanize it.", 1
"Twenty years of continuous slavery, of systematic humiliation, of constant prostration, finally create in the mind a twist that cannot be straightened by the labor of a day.", 1
"Good and evil instincts are inherited and transmitted from father to son.", 1
"Then let your idylic ideas live, your dreams of a slave who asks only for a bandage to wrap the chain so that it may rattle less and not ulcerate his skin!", 3
"You hope for a little home and some ease, a wife and a handful of rice—here is your ideal man of the Philippines!", 3
"Well, if they give it to you, consider yourself fortunate.”", 3
"Basilio, accustomed to obey and bear with the caprices and humors of Capitan Tiago. was now dominated by Simoun, who appeared to him terrible and sinister on a background bathed in tears and blood.", 1
"He tried to explain himself by saying that he did not consider himself fit to mix in politics, that he had no political opinions because he had never studied the question, but that he was always ready to lend his services the day they might be needed, that for the moment he saw only one need, the enlightenment of the people.", 1
"Simoun stopped him with a gesture, and, as the dawn was coming, said to him: “Young man, I am not warning you to keep my secret, because I know that discretion is one of your good qualities, and even though you might wish to sell me, the jeweler Simoun, the friend of the authorities and of the religious corporations, will always be given more credit than the student Basilio, already suspected of filibusterism, and, being a native, so much the more marked and watched, and because in the profession you are entering upon you will encounter powerful rivals.", 1
"After all, even though you have not corresponded to my hopes, the day on which you change your mind, look me up at my house in the Escolta, and I’ll be glad to help you.”", 1
"Basilio thanked him briefly and went away.", 1
"“Have I really made a mistake?” mused Simoun, when he found himself alone.", 3
"Is it that he doubts me and meditates his plan of revenge so secretly that he fears to tell it even in the solitude of the night?", 3
"Or can it be that the years of servitude have extinguished in his heart every human sentiment and there remain only the animal desires to live and reproduce?", 3
"In that case the type is deformed and will have to be cast over again.", 1
"Then the hecatomb is preparing: let the unfit perish and only the strongest survive!”", 1
"Then he added sadly, as if apostrophizing some one: “Have patience, you who left me a name and a home, have patience!", 1
"I have lost all—country, future, prosperity, your very tomb, but have patience!", 1
"And thou, noble spirit, great soul, generous heart, who didst live with only one thought and didst sacrifice thy life without asking the gratitude or applause of any one, have patience, have patience!", 1
"The methods that I use may perhaps not be thine, but they are the most direct.", 1
"The day is coming, and when it brightens I myself will come to announce it to you who are now indifferent.", 1
"Have patience!”", 1
"When Juli opened her sorrowing eyes, she saw that the house was still dark, but the cocks were crowing.", 1
"Her first thought was that perhaps the Virgin had performed the miracle and the sun was not going to rise, in spite of the invocations of the cocks.", 3
"She rose, crossed herself, recited her morning prayers with great devotion, and with as little noise as possible went out on the batalan.", 1
"There was no miracle—the sun was rising and promised a magnificent morning, the breeze was delightfully cool, the stars were paling in the east, and the cocks were crowing as if to see who could crow best and loudest.", 1
"That had been too much to ask—it were much easier to request the Virgin to send the two hundred and fifty pesos.", 3
"What would it cost the Mother of the Lord to give them?", 3
"But underneath the image she found only the letter of her father asking for the ransom of five hundred pesos.", 1
"There was nothing to do but go, so, seeing that her grandfather was not stirring, she thought him asleep and began to prepare breakfast.", 1
"Strange, she was calm, she even had a desire to laugh!", 1
"What had she had last night to afflict her so?", 3
"She was not going very far, she could come every second day to visit the house, her grandfather could see her, and as for Basilio, he had known for some time the bad turn her father’s affairs had taken, since he had often said to her, “When I’m a physician and we are married, your father won’t need his fields.”", 1
"“What a fool I was to cry so much,” she said to herself as she packed her tampipi.", 1
"Her fingers struck against the locket and she pressed it to her lips, but immediately wiped them from fear of contagion, for that locket set with diamonds and emeralds had come from a leper.", 1
"Ah, then, if she should catch that disease she could not get married.", 1
"As it became lighter, she could see her grandfather seated in a corner, following all her movements with his eyes, so she caught up her tampipi of clothes and approached him smilingly to kiss his hand.", 1
"The old man blessed her silently, while she tried to appear merry.", 1
"Seeing the old man’s eyes fill with tears, she placed the tampipi on her head and hastily went downstairs, her slippers slapping merrily on the wooden steps.", 1
"But when she turned her head to look again at the house, the house wherein had faded her childhood dreams and her maiden illusions, when she saw it sad, lonely, deserted, with the windows half closed, vacant and dark like a dead man’s eyes, when she heard the low rustling of the bamboos, and saw them nodding in the fresh morning breeze as though bidding her farewell, then her vivacity disappeared; she stopped, her eyes filled with tears, and letting herself fall in a sitting posture on a log by the wayside she broke out into disconsolate tears.", 1
"Juli had been gone several hours and the sun was quite high overhead when Tandang Selo gazed from the window at the people in their festival garments going to the town to attend the high mass.", 1
"Nearly all led by the hand or carried in their arms a little boy or girl decked out as if for a fiesta.", 1
"Christmas day in the Philippines is, according to the elders, a fiesta for the children, who are perhaps not of the same opinion and who, it may be supposed, have for it an instinctive dread.", 3
"They are roused early, washed, dressed, and decked out with everything new, dear, and precious that they possess—high silk shoes, big hats, woolen or velvet suits, without overlooking four or five scapularies, which contain texts from St. John, and thus burdened they are carried to the high mass, where for almost an hour they are subjected to the heat and the human smells from so many crowding, perspiring people, and if they are not made to recite the rosary they must remain quiet, bored, or asleep.", 1
"At each movement or antic that may soil their clothing they are pinched and scolded, so the fact is that they do not laugh or feel happy, while in their round eyes can be read a protest against so much embroidery and a longing for the old shirt of week-days.", 1
"Afterwards, they are dragged from house to house to kiss their relatives’ hands.", 1
"There they have to dance, sing, and recite all the amusing things they know, whether in the humor or not, whether comfortable or not in their fine clothes, with the eternal pinchings and scoldings if they play any of their tricks.", 1
"Their relatives give them cuartos which their parents seize upon and of which they hear nothing more.", 1
"The only positive results they are accustomed to get from the fiesta are the marks of the aforesaid pinchings, the vexations, and at best an attack of indigestion from gorging themselves with candy and cake in the houses of kind relatives.", 1
"But such is the custom, and Filipino children enter the world through these ordeals, which afterwards prove the least sad, the least hard, of their lives.", 3
"Adult persons who live independently also share in this fiesta, by visiting their parents and their parents’ relatives, crooking their knees, and wishing them a merry Christmas.", 1
"Their Christmas gift consists of a sweetmeat, some fruit, a glass of water, or some insignificant present.", 1
"Tandang Selo saw all his friends pass and thought sadly that this year he had no Christmas gift for anybody, while his granddaughter had gone without hers, without wishing him a merry Christinas.", 1
"Was it delicacy on Juli’s part or pure forgetfulness?", 3
"When he tried to greet the relatives who called on him, bringing their children, he found to his great surprise that he could not articulate a word.", 1
"Vainly he tried, but no sound could he utter.", 1
"He placed his hands on his throat, shook his head, but without effect.", 1
"When he tried to laugh, his lips trembled convulsively and the only noise produced was a hoarse wheeze like the blowing of bellows.", 1
"The women gazed at him in consternation.", 1
"“He’s dumb, he’s dumb!” they cried in astonishment, raising at once a literal pandemonium.", 1
"When the news of this misfortune became known in the town, some lamented it and others shrugged their shoulders.", 1
"No one was to blame, and no one need lay it on his conscience.", 3
"The lieutenant of the Civil Guard gave no sign: he had received an order to take up all the arms and he had performed his duty.", 1
"He had chased the tulisanes whenever he could, and when they captured Cabesang Tales he had organized an expedition and brought into the town, with their arms bound behind them, five or six rustics who looked suspicious, so if Cabesang Tales did not show up it was because he was not in the pockets or under the skins of the prisoners, who were thoroughly shaken out.", 1
"The friar-administrator shrugged his shoulders: he had nothing to do with it, it was a matter of tulisanes and he had merely done his duty.", 1
"True it was that if he had not entered the complaint, perhaps the arms would not have been taken up, and poor Tales would not have been captured; but he, Fray Clemente, had to look after his own safety, and that Tales had a way of staring at him as if picking out a good target in some part of his body.", 1
"Self-defense is natural.", 1
"If there are tulisanes, the fault is not his, it is not his duty to run them down—that belongs to the Civil Guard.", 1
"If Cabesang Tales, instead of wandering about his fields, had stayed at home, he would not have been captured.", 1
"In short, that was a punishment from heaven upon those who resisted the demands of his corporation.", 3
"When Sister Penchang, the pious old woman in whose service Juli had entered, learned of it, she ejaculated several ’Susmarioseps, crossed herself, and remarked, “Often God sends these trials because we are sinners or have sinning relatives, to whom we should have taught piety and we haven’t done so.”", 1
"Those sinning relatives referred to Juliana, for to this pious woman Juli was a great sinner.", 1
"Greatly scandalized, she made the sign of the cross and thanked God, who had permitted the capture of the father in order that the daughter might be snatched from sin and learn the virtues which, according to the curates, should adorn every Christian woman.", 3
"She therefore kept the girl constantly at work, not allowing her to return to the village to look after her grandfather.", 1
"Juli had to learn how to pray, to read the books distributed by the friars, and to work until the two hundred and fifty pesos should be paid.", 1
"When she learned that Basilio had gone to Manila to get his savings and ransom Juli from her servitude, the good woman believed that the girl was forever lost and that the devil had presented himself in the guise of the student.", 3
"Meanwhile, the friars had gained their point.", 1
"They had certainly won the suit, so they took advantage of Cabesang Tales’ captivity to turn the fields over to the one who had asked for them, without the least thought of honor or the faintest twinge of shame.", 1
"When the former owner returned and learned what had happened, when he saw his fields in another’s possession,—those fields that had cost the lives of his wife and daughter,—when he saw his father dumb and his daughter working as a servant, and when he himself received an order from the town council, transmitted through the headman of the village, to move out of the house within three days, he said nothing; he sat down at his father’s side and spoke scarcely once during the whole day.", 1
"On the following day, to the great surprise of the village, the jeweler Simoun, followed by two servants, each carrying a canvas-covered chest, requested the hospitality of Cabesang Tales, who even in the midst of his wretchedness did not forget the good Filipino customs—rather, he was troubled to think that he had no way of properly entertaining the stranger.", 1
"But Simoun brought everything with him, servants and provisions, and merely wished to spend the day and night in the house because it was the largest in the village and was situated between San Diego and Tiani, towns where he hoped to find many customers.", 1
"Simoun secured information about the condition of the roads and asked Cabesang Tales if his revolver was a sufficient protection against the tulisanes.", 1
"“They have rifles that shoot a long way,” was the rather absent-minded reply.", 1
"“This revolver does no less,” remarked Simoun, firing at an areca-palm some two hundred paces away.", 1
"Cabesang Tales noticed that some nuts fell, but remained silent and thoughtful.", 1
"Gradually the families, drawn by the fame of the jeweler’s wares, began to collect.", 1
"They wished one another merry Christmas, they talked of masses, saints, poor crops, but still were there to spend their savings for jewels and trinkets brought from Europe.", 1
"It was known that the jeweler was the friend of the Captain-General, so it wasn’t lost labor to get on good terms with him, and thus be prepared for contingencies.", 3
"Capitan Basilio came with his wife, daughter, and son-in-law, prepared to spend at least three thousand pesos.", 1
"Sister Penchang was there to buy a diamond ring she had promised to the Virgin of Antipolo.", 1
"She had left Juli at home memorizing a booklet the curate had sold her for four cuartos, with forty days of indulgence granted by the Archbishop to every one who read it or listened to it read.", 1
"“Jesús!” said the pious woman to Capitana Tika, “that poor girl has grown up like a mushroom planted by the tikbalang.", 1
"I’ve made her read the book at the top of her voice at least fifty times and she doesn’t remember a single word of it.", 1
"She has a head like a sieve—full when it’s in the water.", 3
"All of us hearing her, even the dogs and cats, have won at least twenty years of indulgence.”", 3
"Simoun arranged his two chests on the table, one being somewhat larger than the other.", 1
"“You don’t want plated jewelry or imitation gems.", 1
"This lady,” turning to Sinang, “wants real diamonds.”", 1
"Papa will pay for them, because he likes antique things, antique stones.”", 1
"Sinang was accustomed to joke about the great deal of Latin her father understood and the little her husband knew.", 1
"“It just happens that I have some antique jewels,” replied Simoun, taking the canvas cover from the smaller chest, a polished steel case with bronze trimmings and stout locks.", 1
"“I have necklaces of Cleopatra’s, real and genuine, discovered in the Pyramids; rings of Roman senators and knights, found in the ruins of Carthage.”", 1
"“Probably those that Hannibal sent back after the battle of Cannae!” exclaimed Capitan Basilio seriously, while he trembled with pleasure.", 1
"The good man, thought he had read much about the ancients, had never, by reason of the lack of museums in Filipinas, seen any of the objects of those times.", 1
"“I have brought besides costly earrings of Roman ladies, discovered in the villa of Annius Mucius Papilinus in Pompeii.”", 1
"Capitan Easilio nodded to show that he understood and was eager to see such precious relics.", 1
"The women remarked that they also wanted things from Rome, such as rosaries blessed by the Pope, holy relics that would take away sins without the need of confessions, and so on.", 1
"When the chest was opened and the cotton packing removed, there was exposed a tray filled with rings, reliquaries, lockets, crucifixes, brooches, and such like.", 1
"The diamonds set in among variously colored stones flashed out brightly and shimmered among golden flowers of varied hues, with petals of enamel, all of peculiar designs and rare Arabesque workmanship.", 1
"Simoun lifted the tray and exhibited another filled with quaint jewels that would have satisfied the imaginations of seven débutantes on the eves of the balls in their honor.", 1
"Designs, one more fantastic than the other, combinations of precious stones and pearls worked into the figures of insects with azure backs and transparent forewings, sapphires, emeralds, rubies, turquoises, diamonds, joined to form dragon-flies, wasps, bees, butterflies, beetles, serpents, lizards, fishes, sprays of flowers.", 1
"There were diadems, necklaces of pearls and diamonds, so that some of the girls could not withhold a nakú of admiration, and Sinang gave a cluck with her tongue, whereupon her mother pinched her to prevent her from encouraging the jeweler to raise his prices, for Capitana Tika still pinched her daughter even after the latter was married.", 1
"“Here you have some old diamonds,” explained the jeweler.", 1
"“This ring belonged to the Princess Lamballe and those earrings to one of Marie Antoinette’s ladies.”", 1
"They consisted of some beautiful solitaire diamonds, as large as grains of corn, with somewhat bluish lights, and pervaded with a severe elegance, as though they still reflected in their sparkles the shuddering of the Reign of Terror.", 1
"“Those two earrings!” exclaimed Sinang, looking at her father and instinctively covering the arm next to her mother.", 1
"“Something more ancient yet, something Roman,” said Capitan Basilio with a wink.", 1
"The pious Sister Penchang thought that with such a gift the Virgin of Antipolo would be softened and grant her her most vehement desire: for some time she had begged for a wonderful miracle to which her name would be attached, so that her name might be immortalized on earth and she then ascend into heaven, like the Capitana Ines of the curates.", 1
"She inquired the price and Simoun asked three thousand pesos, which made the good woman cross herself—’Susmariosep!", 1
"Simoun now exposed the third tray, which was filled with watches, cigar- and match-cases decorated with the rarest enamels, reliquaries set with diamonds and containing the most elegant miniatures.", 1
"The fourth tray, containing loose gems, stirred a murmur of admiration.", 1
"Sinang again clucked with her tongue, her mother again pinched her, although at the same time herself emitting a ’Susmaría of wonder.", 1
"No one there had ever before seen so much wealth.", 1
"In that chest lined with dark-blue velvet, arranged in trays, were the wonders of the Arabian Nights, the dreams of Oriental fantasies.", 1
"As if to increase the admiration of the beholders, Simoun took the stones out with his tapering brown fingers, gloating over their crystalline hardness, their luminous stream, as they poured from his hands like drops of water reflecting the tints of the rainbow.", 1
"The reflections from so many facets, the thought of their great value, fascinated the gaze of every one.", 1
"Cabesang Tales, who had approached out of curiosity, closed his eyes and drew back hurriedly, as if to drive away an evil thought.", 1
"Such great riches were an insult to his misfortunes; that man had come there to make an exhibition of his immense wealth on the very day that he, Tales, for lack of money, for lack of protectors, had to abandon the house raised by his own hands.", 3
"“Here you have two black diamonds, among the largest in existence,” explained the jeweler.", 1
"“They’re very difficult to cut because they’re the very hardest.", 1
"This somewhat rosy stone is also a diamond, as is this green one that many take for an emerald.", 1
"Quiroga the Chinaman offered me six thousand pesos for it in order to present it to a very influential lady, and yet it is not the green ones that are the most valuable, but these blue ones.”", 1
"He selected three stones of no great size, but thick and well-cut, of a delicate azure tint.", 1
"Before such great wealth, all under the power of that man who talked so unaffectedly, the spectators felt a kind of awe mingled with dread.", 1
"Sinang clucked several times and her mother did not pinch her, perhaps because she too was overcome, or perhaps because she reflected that a jeweler like Simoun was not going to try to gain five pesos more or less as a result of an exclamation more or less indiscreet.", 3
"All gazed at the gems, but no one showed any desire to handle them, they were so awe-inspiring.", 1
"Curiosity was blunted by wonder.", 1
"Cabesang Tales stared out into the field, thinking that with a single diamond, perhaps the very smallest there, he could recover his daughter, keep his house, and perhaps rent another farm.", 1
"Could it be that those gems were worth more than a man’s home, the safety of a maiden, the peace of an old man in his declining days?", 3
"As if he guessed the thought, Simoun remarked to those about him: “Look here—with one of these little blue stones, which appear so innocent and inoffensive, pure as sparks scattered over the arch of heaven, with one of these, seasonably presented, a man was able to have his enemy deported, the father of a family, as a disturber of the peace; and with this other little one like it, red as one’s heart-blood, as the feeling of revenge, and bright as an orphan’s tears, he was restored to liberty, the man was returned to his home, the father to his children, the husband to the wife, and a whole family saved from a wretched future.”", 3
"He slapped the chest and went on in a loud tone in bad Tagalog: “Here I have, as in a medicine-chest, life and death, poison and balm, and with this handful I can drive to tears all the inhabitants of the Philippines!”", 1
"The listeners gazed at him awe-struck, knowing him to be right.", 1
"In his voice there could be detected a strange ring, while sinister flashes seemed to issue from behind the blue goggles.", 1
"Then as if to relieve the strain of the impression made by the gems on such simple folk, he lifted up the tray and exposed at the bottom the sanctum sanctorum.", 1
"Cases of Russian leather, separated by layers of cotton, covered a bottom lined with gray velvet.", 1
"All expected wonders, and Sinang’s husband thought he saw carbuncles, gems that flashed fire and shone in the midst of the shadows.", 1
"Capitan Basilio was on the threshold of immortality: he was going to behold something real, something beyond his dreams.", 1
"“This was a necklace of Cleopatra’s,” said Simoun, taking out carefully a flat case in the shape of a half-moon.", 1
"“It’s a jewel that can’t be appraised, an object for a museum, only for a rich government.”", 1
"It was a necklace fashioned of bits of gold representing little idols among green and blue beetles, with a vulture’s head made from a single piece of rare jasper at the center between two extended wings—the symbol and decoration of Egyptian queens.", 1
"Sinang turned up her nose and made a grimace of childish depreciation, while Capitan Basilio, with all his love for antiquity, could not restrain an exclamation of disappointment.", 1
"“It’s a magnificent jewel, well-preserved, almost two thousand years old.”", 1
"“Pshaw!” Sinang made haste to exclaim, to prevent her father’s falling into temptation.", 1
"“Fool!” he chided her, after overcoming his first disappointment.", 1
"How do you know but that to this necklace is due the present condition of the world?", 3
"With this Cleopatra may have captivated Caesar, Mark Antony!", 1
"This has heard the burning declarations of love from the greatest warriors of their time, it has listened to speeches in the purest and most elegant Latin, and yet you would want to wear it!”", 1
"“I? I wouldn’t give three pesos for it.”", 1
"“You could give twenty, silly,” said Capitana Tika in a judicial tone.", 1
"“The gold is good and melted down would serve for other jewelry.”", 1
"“This is a ring that must have belonged to Sulla,” continued Simoun, exhibiting a heavy ring of solid gold with a seal on it.", 1
"“With that he must have signed the death-wrarrants during his dictatorship!” exclaimed Capitan Basilio, pale with emotion.", 1
"He examined it and tried to decipher the seal, but though he turned it over and over he did not understand paleography, so he could not read it.", 1
"“What a finger Sulla had!” he observed finally.", 1
"“This would fit two of ours—as I’ve said, we’re degenerating!”", 1
"“I still have many other jewels—”", 1
"“If they’re all that kind, never mind!” interrupted Sinang.", 3
"“I think I prefer the modern.”", 1
"Each one selected some piece of jewelry, one a ring, another a watch, another a locket.", 1
"Capitana Tika bought a reliquary that contained a fragment of the stone on which Our Saviour rested at his third fall; Sinang a pair of earrings; and Capitan Basilio the watch-chain for the alferez, the lady’s earrings for the curate, and other gifts.", 1
"The families from the town of Tiani, not to be outdone by those of San Diego, in like manner emptied their purses.", 1
"Simoun bought or exchanged old jewelry, brought there by economical mothers, to whom it was no longer of use.", 1
"“You, haven’t you something to sell?” he asked Cabesang Tales, noticing the latter watching the sales and exchanges with covetous eyes, but the reply was that all his daughter’s jewels had been sold, nothing of value remained.", 1
"“What about Maria Clara’s locket?” inquired Sinang.", 1
"“True!” the man exclaimed, and his eyes blazed for a moment.", 1
"“It’s a locket set with diamonds and emeralds,” Sinang told the jeweler.", 1
"“My old friend wore it before she became a nun.”", 1
"Simoun said nothing, but anxiously watched Cabesang Tales, who, after opening several boxes, found the locket.", 1
"He examined it carefully, opening and shutting it repeatedly.", 1
"It was the same locket that Maria Clara had worn during the fiesta in San Diego and which she had in a moment of compassion given to a leper.", 1
"“I like the design,” said Simoun.", 1
"“How much do you want for it?”", 1
"Cabesang Tales scratched his head in perplexity, then his ear, then looked at the women.", 1
"“I’ve taken a fancy to this locket,” Simoun went on.", 1
"“Will you take a hundred, five hundred pesos?", 1
"Do you want to exchange it for something else?", 1
"Take your choice here!”", 1
"Tales stared foolishly at Simoun, as if in doubt of what he heard.", 1
"“Five hundred pesos?” he murmured.", 1
"“Five hundred,” repeated the jeweler in a voice shaking with emotion.", 1
"Cabesang Tales took the locket and made several turns about the room, with his heart beating violently and his hands trembling.", 1
"Dared he ask more?", 3
"That locket could save him, this was an excellent opportunity, such as might not again present itself.", 1
"The women winked at him to encourage him to make the sale, excepting Penchang, who, fearing that Juli would be ransomed, observed piously: “I would keep it as a relic.", 1
"Those who have seen Maria Clara in the nunnery say she has got so thin and weak that she can scarcely talk and it’s thought that she’ll die a saint.", 1
"Padre Salvi speaks very highly of her and he’s her confessor.", 1
"That’s why Juli didn’t want ito give it up, but rather preferred to pawn herself.”", 1
"This speech had its effect—the thought of his daughter restrained Tales.", 1
"“If you will allow me,” he said, “I’ll go to the town to consult my daughter.", 1
"I’ll be back before night.”", 1
"This was agreed upon and Tales set out at once.", 1
"But when he found himself outside of the village, he made out at a distance, on a path, that entered the woods, the friar-administrator and a man whom he recognized as the usurper of his land.", 1
"A husband seeing his wife enter a private room with another man could not feel more wrath or jealousy than Cabesang Tales experienced when he saw them moving over his fields, the fields cleared by him, which he had thought to leave to his children.", 1
"It seemed to him that they were mocking him, laughing at his powerlessness.", 1
"There flashed into his memory what he had said about never giving up his fields except to him who irrigated them with his own blood and buried in them his wife and daughter.", 1
"He stopped, rubbed his hand over his forehead, and shut his eyes.", 1
"When he again opened them, he saw that the man had turned to laugh and that the friar had caught his sides as though to save himself from bursting with merriment, then he saw them point toward his house and laugh again.", 1
"A buzz sounded in his ears, he felt the crack of a whip around his chest, the red mist reappeared before his eyes, he again saw the corpses of his wife and daughter, and beside them the usurper with the friar laughing and holding his sides.", 1
"Forgetting everything else, he turned aside into the path they had taken, the one leading to his fields.", 1
"Simoun waited in vain for Cabesang Tales to return that night.", 1
"But the next morning when he arose he noticed that the leather holster of his revolver was empty.", 1
"Opening it he found inside a scrap of paper wrapped around the locket set with emeralds and diamonds, with these few lines written on it in Tagalog:", 1
"Telesforo Juan de Dios.”", 1
"“At last I’ve found my man!” muttered Simoun with a deep breath.", 1
"“He’s somewhat scrupulous, but so much the better—he’ll keep his promises.”", 3
"He then ordered a servant to go by boat over the lake to Los Baños with the larger chest and await him there.", 1
"He would go on overland, taking the smaller chest, the one containing his famous jewels.", 1
"The arrival of four civil-guards completed his good humor.", 1
"They came to arrest Cabesang Tales and not finding him took Tandang Selo away instead.", 1
"Three murders had been committed during the night.", 1
"The friar-administrator and the new tenant of Cabesang Tales’ land had been found dead, with their heads split open and their mouths full of earth, on the border of the fields.", 1
"In the town the wife of the usurper was found dead at dawn, her mouth also filled with earth and her throat cut, with a fragment of paper beside her, on which was the name Tales, written in blood as though traced by a finger.", 1
"Calm yourselves, peaceful inhabitants of Kalamba!", 1
"None of you are named Tales, none of you have committed any crime!", 1
"You are called Luis Habaña, Matías Belarmino, Nicasio Eigasani, Cayetano de Jesús, Mateo Elejorde, Leandro Lopez, Antonino Lopez, Silvestre Ubaldo, Manuel Hidalgo, Paciano Mercado, your name is the whole village of Kalamba.", 1
"You cleared your fields, on them you have spent the labor of your whole lives, your savings, your vigils and privations, and you have been despoiled of them, driven from your homes, with the rest forbidden to show you hospitality!", 1
"Not content with outraging justice, they [20] have trampled upon the sacred traditions of your country!", 1
"You have served Spain and the King, and when in their name you have asked for justice, you were banished without trial, torn from your wives’ arms and your children’s caresses!", 1
"Any one of you has suffered more than Cabesang Tales, and yet none, not one of you, has received justice!", 1
"Neither pity nor humanity has been shown you—you have been persecuted beyond the tomb, as was Mariano Herbosa!", 1
"Weep or laugh, there in those lonely isles where you wander vaguely, uncertain of the future!", 1
"Spain, the generous Spain, is watching over you, and sooner or later you will have justice!", 3
"His Excellency, the Captain-General and Governor of the Philippine Islands, had been hunting in Bosoboso.", 1
"But as he had to be accompanied by a band of music,—since such an exalted personage was not to be esteemed less than the wooden images carried in the processions,—and as devotion to the divine art of St. Cecilia has not yet been popularized among the deer and wild boars of Bosoboso, his Excellency, with the band of music and train of friars, soldiers, and clerks, had not been able to catch a single rat or a solitary bird.", 1
"The provincial authorities foresaw dismissals and transfers, the poor gobernadorcillos and cabezas de barangay were restless and sleepless, fearing that the mighty hunter in his wrath might have a notion to make up with their persons for the lack of submissiveness on the part of the beasts of the forest, as had been done years before by an alcalde who had traveled on the shoulders of impressed porters because he found no horses gentle enough to guarantee his safety.", 1
"There was not lacking an evil rumor that his Excellency had decided to take some action, since in this he saw the first symptoms of a rebellion which should be strangled in its infancy, that a fruitless hunt hurt the prestige of the Spanish name, that he already had his eye on a wretch to be dressed up as a deer, when his Excellency, with clemency that Ben-Zayb lacked words to extol sufficiently, dispelled all the fears by declaring that it pained him to sacrifice to his pleasure the beasts of the forest.", 3
"But to tell the truth, his Excellency was secretly very well satisfied, for what would have happened had he missed a shot at a deer, one of those not familiar with political etiquette?", 3
"What would the prestige of the sovereign power have come to then?", 3
"A Captain-General of the Philippines missing a shot, like a raw hunter?", 3
"What would have been said by the Indians, among whom there were some fair huntsmen?", 3
"The integrity of the fatherland would have been endangered.", 3
"So it was that his Excellency, with a sheepish smile, and posing as a disappointed hunter, ordered an immediate return to Los Baños.", 1
"During the journey he related with an indifferent air his hunting exploits in this or that forest of the Peninsula, adopting a tone somewhat depreciative, as suited the case, toward hunting in Filipinas.", 1
"The bath in Dampalit, the hot springs on the shore of the lake, card-games in the palace, with an occasional excursion to some neighboring waterfall, or the lake infested with caymans, offered more attractions and fewer risks to the integrity of the fatherland.", 1
"Thus on one of the last days of December, his Excellency found himself in the sala, taking a hand at cards while he awaited the breakfast hour.", 1
"He had come from the bath, with the usual glass of coconut-milk and its soft meat, so he was in the best of humors for granting favors and privileges.", 1
"His good humor was increased by his winning a good many hands, for Padre Irene and Padre Sibyla, with whom he was playing, were exercising all their skill in secretly trying to lose, to the great irritation of Padre Camorra, who on account of his late arrival only that morning was not informed as to the game they were playing on the General.", 3
"The friar-artilleryman was playing in good faith and with great care, so he turned red and bit his lip every time Padre Sibyla seemed inattentive or blundered, but he dared not say a word by reason of the respect he felt for the Dominican.", 1
"In exchange he took his revenge out on Padre Irene, whom he looked upon as a base fawner and despised for his coarseness.", 1
"Padre Sibyla let him scold, while the humbler Padre Irene tried to excuse himself by rubbing his long nose.", 1
"His Excellency was enjoying it and took advantage, like the good tactician that the Canon hinted he was, of all the mistakes of his opponents.", 1
"Padre Camorra was ignorant of the fact that across the table they were playing for the intellectual development of the Filipinos, the instruction in Castilian, but had he known it he would doubtless have joyfully entered into that game.", 3
"The open balcony admitted the fresh, pure breeze and revealed the lake, whose waters murmured sweetly around the base of the edifice, as if rendering homage.", 1
"On the right, at a distance, appeared Talim Island, a deep blue in the midst of the lake, while almost in front lay the green and deserted islet of Kalamba, in the shape of a half-moon.", 1
"To the left the picturesque shores were fringed with clumps of bamboo, then a hill overlooking the lake, with wide ricefields beyond, then red roofs amid the deep green of the trees,—the town of Kalamba,—and beyond the shore-line fading into the distance, with the horizon at the back closing down over the water, giving the lake the appearance of a sea and justifying the name the Indians give it of dagat na tabang, or fresh-water sea.", 1
"At the end of the sala, seated before a table covered with documents, was the secretary.", 1
"His Excellency was a great worker and did not like to lose time, so he attended to business in the intervals of the game or while dealing the cards.", 1
"Meanwhile, the bored secretary yawned and despaired.", 1
"That morning he had worked, as usual, over transfers, suspensions of employees, deportations, pardons, and the like, but had not yet touched the great question that had stirred so much interest—the petition of the students requesting permission to establish an academy of Castilian.", 1
"Pacing from one end of the room to the other and conversing animatedly but in low tones were to be seen Don Custodio, a high official, and a friar named Padre Fernandez, who hung his head with an air either of meditation or annoyance.", 1
"From an adjoining room issued the click of balls striking together and bursts of laughter, amid which might be heard the sharp, dry voice of Simoun, who was playing billiards with Ben-Zayb.", 1
"Suddenly Padre Camorra arose.", 1
"“The devil with this game, puñales!” he exclaimed, throwing his cards at Padre Irene’s head.", 1
"“Puñales, that trick, if not all the others, was assured and we lost by default!", 1
"Puñales!", 1
"The devil with this game!”", 1
"He explained the situation angrily to all the occupants of the sala, addressing himself especially to the three walking about, as if he had selected them for judges.", 1
"The general played thus, he replied with such a card, Padre Irene had a certain card; he led, and then that fool of a Padre Irene didn’t play his card!", 1
"Padre Irene was giving the game away!", 1
"It was a devil of a way to play!", 1
"His mother’s son had not come here to rack his brains for nothing and lose his money!", 1
"Then he added, turning very red, “If the booby thinks my money grows on every bush!...", 1
"On top of the fact that my Indians are beginning to haggle over payments!”", 1
"Fuming, and disregarding the excuses of Padre Irene, who tried to explain while he rubbed the tip of his beak in order to conceal his sly smile, he went into the billiardroom.", 1
"“Padre Fernandez, would you like to take a hand?” asked Fray Sibyla.", 1
"“I’m a very poor player,” replied the friar with a grimace.", 1
"“Then get Simoun,” said the General.", 1
"“Eh, Simoun!", 1
"Eh, Mister, won’t you try a hand?”", 1
"“What is your disposition concerning the arms for sporting purposes?” asked the secretary, taking advantage of the pause.", 1
"Simoun thrust his head through the doorway.", 1
"“Don’t you want to take Padre Camorra’s place, Señor Sindbad?” inquired Padre Irene.", 1
"“You can bet diamonds instead of chips.”", 1
"“I don’t care if I do,” replied Simoun, advancing while he brushed the chalk from his hands.", 1
"“What will you bet?”", 1
"“What should we bet?” returned Padre Sibyla.", 1
"“The General can bet what he likes, but we priests, clerics—”", 1
"“Bah!” interrupted Simoun ironically.", 1
"“You and Padre Irene can pay with deeds of charity, prayers, and virtues, eh?”", 3
"“You know that the virtues a person may possess,” gravely argued Padre Sibyla, “are not like the diamonds that may pass from hand to hand, to be sold and resold.", 1
"They are inherent in the being, they are essential attributes of the subject—”", 1
"“I’ll be satisfied then if you pay me with promises,” replied Simoun jestingly.", 1
"“You, Padre Sibyla, instead of paying me five something or other in money, will say, for example: for five days I renounce poverty, humility, and obedience.", 1
"You, Padre Irene: I renounce chastity, liberality, and so on.", 1
"Those are small matters, and I’m putting up my diamonds.”", 1
"“What a peculiar man this Simoun is, what notions he has!” exclaimed Padre Irene with a smile.", 1
"“And he,” continued Simoun, slapping his Excellency familiarly on the shoulder, “he will pay me with an order for five days in prison, or five months, or an order of deportation made out in blank, or let us say a summary execution by the Civil Guard while my man is being conducted from one town to another.”", 1
"This was a strange proposition, so the three who had been pacing about gathered around.", 1
"“But, Señor Simoun,” asked the high official, “what good will you get out of winning promises of virtues, or lives and deportations and summary executions?”", 1
"“A great deal!", 1
"I’m tired of hearing virtues talked about and would like to have the whole of them, all there are in the world, tied up in a sack, in order to throw them into the sea, even though I had to use my diamonds for sinkers.”", 1
"“What an idea!” exclaimed Padre Irene with another smile.", 1
"“And the deportations and executions, what of them?”", 1
"“Well, to clean the country and destroy every evil seed.”", 1
"“Get out! You’re still sore at the tulisanes.", 1
"But you were lucky that they didn’t demand a larger ransom or keep all your jewels.", 1
"Man, don’t be ungrateful!”", 1
"Simoun proceeded to relate how he had been intercepted by a band of tulisanes, who, after entertaining him for a day, had let him go on his way without exacting other ransom than his two fine revolvers and the two boxes of cartridges he carried with him.", 1
"He added that the tulisanes had charged him with many kind regards for his Excellency, the Captain-General.", 1
"As a result of this, and as Simoun reported that the tulisanes were well provided with shotguns, rifles, and revolvers, and against such persons one man alone, no matter how well armed, could not defend himself, his Excellency, to prevent the tulisanes from getting weapons in the future, was about to dictate a new decree forbidding the introduction of sporting arms.", 1
"“On the contrary, on the contrary!” protested Simoun, “for me the tulisanes are the most respectable men in the country, they’re the only ones who earn their living honestly.", 3
"Suppose I had fallen into the hands—well, of you yourselves, for example, would you have let me escape without taking half of my jewels, at least?”", 3
"Don Custodio was on the point of protesting; that Simoun was really a rude American mulatto taking advantage of his friendship with the Captain-General to insult Padre Irene, although it may be true also that Padre Irene would hardly have set him free for so little.", 3
"“The evil is not,” went on Simoun, “in that there are tulisanes in the mountains and uninhabited parts—the evil lies in the tulisanes in the towns and cities.”", 1
"“Like yourself,” put in the Canon with a smile.", 3
"“Yes, like myself, like all of us!", 1
"Let’s be frank, for no Indian is listening to us here,” continued the jeweler.", 1
"“The evil is that we’re not all openly declared tulisanes.", 1
"When that happens and we all take to the woods, on that day the country will be saved, on that day will rise a new social order which will take care of itself, and his Excellency will be able to play his game in peace, without the necessity of having his attention diverted by his secretary.”", 1
"The person mentioned at that moment yawned, extending his folded arms above his head and stretching his crossed legs under the table as far as possible, upon noticing which all laughed.", 1
"His Excellency wished to change the course of the conversation, so, throwing down the cards he had been shuffling, he said half seriously: “Come, come, enough of jokes and cards!", 1
"Let’s get to work, to work in earnest, since we still have a half-hour before breakfast.", 1
"Are there many matters to be got through with?”", 1
"All now gave their attention.", 1
"That was the day for joining battle over the question of instruction in Castilian, for which purpose Padre Sibyla and Padre Irene had been there several days.", 1
"It was known that the former, as Vice-Rector, was opposed to the project and that the latter supported it, and his activity was in turn supported by the Countess.", 1
"“What is there, what is there?” asked his Excellency impatiently.", 1
"“The petition about sporting arms,” replied the secretary with a stifled yawn.", 1
"“Forbidden!”", 1
"“Pardon, General,” said the high official gravely, “your Excellency will permit me to invite your attention to the fact that the use of sporting arms is permitted in all the countries of the world.”", 1
"The General shrugged his shoulders and remarked dryly, “We are not imitating any nation in the world.”", 3
"Between his Excellency and the high official there was always a difference of opinion, so it was sufficient that the latter offer any suggestion whatsoever to have the former remain stubborn.", 1
"The high official tried another tack.", 1
"“Sporting arms can harm only rats and chickens.", 1
"They’ll say—”", 1
"“But are we chickens?” interrupted the General, again shrugging his shoulders.", 3
"“Am I?", 3
"I’ve demonstrated that I’m not.”", 3
"“But there’s another thing,” observed the secretary.", 1
"“Four months ago, when the possession of arms was prohibited, the foreign importers were assured that sporting arms would be admitted.”", 1
"His Excellency knitted his brows.", 1
"“That can be arranged,” suggested Simoun.", 1
"“How?”", 1
"“Very simply.", 1
"Sporting arms nearly all have a caliber of six millimeters, at least those now in the market.", 1
"Authorize only the sale of those that haven’t these six millimeters.”", 1
"All approved this idea of Simoun’s, except the high official, who muttered into Padre Fernandez’s ear that this was not dignified, nor was it the way to govern.", 1
"“The schoolmaster of Tiani,” proceeded the secretary, shuffling some papers about, “asks for a better location for—”", 1
"“What better location can he want than the storehouse that he has all to himself?” interrupted Padre Camorra, who had returned, having forgotten about the card-game.", 1
"“He says that it’s roofless,” replied the secretary, “and that having purchased out of his own pocket some maps and pictures, he doesn’t want to expose them to the weather.”", 1
"“But I haven’t anything to do with that,” muttered his Excellency.", 1
"“He should address the head secretary, [22] the governor of the province, or the nuncio.”", 1
"“I want to tell you,” declared Padre Camorra, “that this little schoolmaster is a discontented filibuster.", 1
"Just imagine—the heretic teaches that corpses rot just the same, whether buried with great pomp or without any!", 1
"Some day I’m going to punch him!”", 1
"Here he doubled up his fists.", 1
"“To tell the truth,” observed Padre Sibyla, as if speaking only to Padre Irene, “he who wishes to teach, teaches everywhere, in the open air.", 1
"Socrates taught in the public streets, Plato in the gardens of the Academy, even Christ among the mountains and lakes.”", 1
"“I’ve heard several complaints against this schoolmaster,” said his Excellency, exchanging a glance with Simoun.", 1
"“I think the best thing would be to suspend him.”", 1
"“Suspended!” repeated the secretary.", 1
"The luck of that unfortunate, who had asked for help and received his dismissal, pained the high official and he tried to do something for him.", 1
"“It’s certain,” he insinuated rather timidly, “that education is not at all well provided for—”", 1
"“I’ve already decreed large sums for the purchase of supplies,” exclaimed his Excellency haughtily, as if to say, “I’ve done more than I ought to have done.”", 3
"“But since suitable locations are lacking, the supplies purchased get ruined.”", 1
"“Everything can’t be done at once,” said his Excellency dryly.", 1
"“The schoolmasters here are doing wrong in asking for buildings when those in Spain starve to death.", 1
"It’s great presumption to be better off here than in the mother country itself!”", 3
"“Filibusterism—”", 1
"“Before everything the fatherland!", 1
"Before everything else we are Spaniards!” added Ben-Zayb, his eyes glowing with patriotism, but he blushed somewhat when he noticed that he was speaking alone.", 1
"“In the future,” decided the General, “all who complain will be suspended.”", 1
"“If my project were accepted—” Don Custodio ventured to remark, as if talking to himself.", 3
"“For the construction of schoolhouses?”", 1
"“It’s simple, practical, economical, and, like all my projects, derived from long experience and knowledge of the country.", 1
"The towns would have schools without costing the government a cuarto.”", 1
"“That’s easy,” observed the secretary sarcastically.", 1
"“Compel the towns to construct them at their own expense,” whereupon all laughed.", 1
"“No, sir! No, sir!” cried the exasperated Don Custodio, turning very red.", 1
"“The buildings are already constructed and only wait to be utilized.", 1
"Hygienic, unsurpassable, spacious—”", 1
"The friars looked at one another uneasily.", 1
"Would Don Custodio propose that the churches and conventos be converted into schoolhouses?", 3
"“Let’s hear it,” said the General with a frown.", 1
"“Well, General, it’s very simple,” replied Don Custodio, drawing himself up and assuming his hollow voice of ceremony.", 1
"“The schools are open only on week-days and the cockpits on holidays.", 1
"Then convert these into schoolhouses, at least during the week.”", 1
"“Man, man, man!”", 1
"“What a lovely idea!”", 3
"“What’s the matter with you, Don Custodio?”", 1
"“That’s a grand suggestion!”", 3
"“That beats them all!”", 3
"“But, gentlemen,” cried Don Custodio, in answer to so many exclamations, “let’s be practical—what places are more suitable than the cockpits?", 1
"They’re large, well constructed, and under a curse for the use to which they are put during the week-days.", 1
"From a moral standpoint my project would be acceptable, by serving as a kind of expiation and weekly purification of the temple of chance, as we might say.”", 1
"“But the fact remains that sometimes there are cockfights during the week,” objected Padre Camorra, “and it wouldn’t be right when the contractors of the cockpits pay the government—” [23]", 1
"“Well, on those days close the school!”", 1
"“Man, man!” exclaimed the scandalized Captain-General.", 1
"“Such an outrage shall never be perpetrated while I govern!", 1
"To close the schools in order to gamble!", 1
"Man, man, I’ll resign first!”", 1
"His Excellency was really horrified.", 1
"“But, General, it’s better to close them for a few days than for months.”", 1
"“It would be immoral,” observed Padre Irene, more indignant even than his Excellency.", 1
"“It’s more immoral that vice has good buildings and learning none.", 1
"Let’s be practical, gentlemen, and not be carried away by sentiment.", 1
"In politics there’s nothing worse than sentiment.", 1
"While from humane considerations we forbid the cultivation of opium in our colonies, we tolerate the smoking of it, and the result is that we do not combat the vice but impoverish ourselves.”", 1
"“But remember that it yields to the government, without any effort, more than four hundred and fifty thousand pesos,” objected Padre Irene, who was getting more and more on the governmental side.", 1
"“Enough, enough, enough!” exclaimed his Excellency, to end the discussion.", 1
"“I have my own plans in this regard and will devote special attention to the matter of public instruction.", 1
"Is there anything else?”", 1
"The secretary looked uneasily toward Padre Sibyla and Padre Irene.", 1
"The cat was about to come out of the bag.", 3
"Both prepared themselves.", 1
"“The petition of the students requesting authorization to open an academy of Castilian,” answered the secretary.", 1
"A general movement was noted among those in the room.", 1
"After glancing at one another they fixed their eyes on the General to learn what his disposition would be.", 1
"For six months the petition had lain there awaiting a decision and had become converted into a kind of casus belli in certain circles.", 1
"His Excellency had lowered his eyes, as if to keep his thoughts from being read.", 1
"The silence became embarrassing, as the General understood, so he asked the high official, “What do you think?”", 1
"“What should I think, General?” responded the person addressed, with a shrug of his shoulders and a bitter smile.", 1
"“What should I think but that the petition is just, very just, and that I am surprised that six months should have been taken to consider it.”", 1
"“The fact is that it involves other considerations,” said Padre Sibyla coldly, as he half closed his eyes.", 1
"The high official again shrugged his shoulders, like one who did not comprehend what those considerations could be.", 1
"Padre Sibyla dared not go on, but looked at Simoun.", 1
"“The petition has a somewhat suspicious character,” corroborated that individual, exchanging a look with the Dominican, who winked several times.", 1
"Padre Irene noticed these things and realized that his cause was almost lost—Simoun was against him.", 1
"“It’s a peaceful rebellion, a revolution on stamped paper,” added Padre Sibyla.", 3
"“Revolution? Rebellion?” inquired the high official, staring from one to the other as if he did not understand what they could mean.", 1
"“It’s headed by some young men charged with being too radical and too much interested in reforms, not to use stronger terms,” remarked the secretary, with a look at the Dominican.", 1
"“He’s a pupil of mine,” put in Padre Fernandez, “and I’m much pleased with him.”", 1
"“Puñales, I like your taste!” exclaimed Padre Camorra.", 1
"“On the steamer we nearly had a fight.", 1
"He’s so insolent that when I gave him a shove aside he returned it.”", 1
"“There’s also one Makaragui or Makarai—”", 1
"“Makaraig,” Padre Irene joined in.", 1
"“A very pleasant and agreeable young man.”", 1
"Then he murmured into the General’s ear, “He’s the one I’ve talked to you about, he’s very rich.", 1
"The Countess recommends him strongly.”", 1
"“Ah!”", 1
"“A medical student, one Basilio—”", 1
"“Of that Basilio, I’ll say nothing,” observed Padre Irene, raising his hands and opening them, as if to say Dominus vobiscum.", 3
"“He’s too deep for me.", 1
"I’ve never succeeded in fathoming what he wants or what he is thinking about.", 1
"It’s a pity that Padre Salvi isn’t present to tell us something about his antecedents.", 1
"I believe that I’ve heard that when a boy he got into trouble with the Civil Guard.", 1
"His father was killed in—I don’t remember what disturbance.”", 1
"Simoun smiled faintly, silently, showing his sharp white teeth.", 1
"“Aha! Aha!” said his Excellency nodding.", 1
"“That’s the kind we have!", 3
"Make a note of that name.”", 1
"“But, General,” objected the high official, seeing that the matter was taking a bad turn, “up to now nothing positive is known against these young men.", 1
"My opinion is that the government, by exhibiting confidence in the people and in its own stability, should grant what is asked, then it could freely revoke the permission when it saw that its kindness was being abused—reasons and pretexts would not be wanting, we can watch them.", 1
"Why cause disaffection among some young men, who later on may feel resentment, when what they ask is commanded by royal decrees?”", 1
"Padre Irene, Don Custodio, and Padre Fernandez nodded in agreement.", 1
"“But the Indians must not understand Castilian, you know,” cried Padre Camorra.", 1
"“They mustn’t learn it, for then they’ll enter into arguments with us, and the Indians must not argue, but obey and pay.", 1
"Just read the Tandang Basio Macunat—that’s a book!", 3
"It tells truths like this!”", 3
"And he held up his clenched fists.", 1
"Padre Sibyla rubbed his hand over his tonsure in sign of impatience.", 1
"“One word,” he began in the most conciliatory tone, though fuming with irritation, “here we’re not dealing with the instruction in Castilian alone.", 1
"Here there is an underhand fight between the students and the University of Santo Tomas.", 1
"If the students win this, our prestige will be trampled in the dirt, they will say that they’ve beaten us and will exult accordingly.", 1
"Then, good-by to moral strength, good-by to everything!", 1
"The first dike broken down, who will restrain this youth?", 3
"With our fall we do no more than signal your own.", 1
"After us, the government!”", 1
"“Puñales, that’s not so!” exclaimed Padre Camorra.", 1
"“We’ll see first who has the biggest fists!”", 1
"At this point Padre Fernandez, who thus far in the discussion had merely contented himself with smiling, began to talk.", 1
"All gave him their attention, for they knew him to be a thoughtful man.", 1
"“Don’t take it ill of me, Padre Sibyla, if I differ from your view of the affair, but it’s my peculiar fate to be almost always in opposition to my brethren.", 1
"I say, then, that we ought not to be so pessimistic.", 1
"The instruction in Castilian can be allowed without any risk whatever, and in order that it may not appear to be a defeat of the University, we Dominicans ought to put forth our efforts and be the first to rejoice over it—that should be our policy.", 1
"To what end are we to be engaged in an everlasting struggle with the people, when after all we are the few and they are the many, when we need them and they do not need us?", 1
"Wait, Padre Camorra, wait!", 1
"Admit that now the people may be weak and ignorant—I also believe that—but it will not be true tomorrow or the day after.", 1
"Tomorrow and the next day they will be the stronger, they will know what is good for them, and we cannot keep it from them, just as it is not possible to keep from children the knowledge of many things when they reach a certain age.", 1
"I say, then, why should we not take advantage of this condition of ignorance to change our policy completely, to place it upon a basis solid and enduring—on the basis of justice, for example, instead of on the basis of ignorance?", 1
"There’s nothing like being just; that I’ve always said to my brethren, but they won’t believe me.", 1
"The Indian idolizes justice, like every race in its youth; he asks for punishment when he has done wrong, just as he is exasperated when he has not deserved it.", 1
"Is theirs a just desire?", 3
"Then grant it!", 1
"Let’s give them all the schools they want, until they are tired of them.", 1
"Youth is lazy, and what urges them to activity is our opposition.", 1
"Our bond of prestige, Padre Sibyla, is about worn out, so let’s prepare another, the bond of gratitude, for example.", 1
"Let’s not be fools, let’s do as the crafty Jesuits—”", 1
"“Padre Fernandez!”", 1
"Anything could be tolerated by Padre Sibyla except to propose the Jesuits to him as a model.", 1
"Pale and trembling, he broke out into bitter recrimination.", 1
"“A Franciscan first!", 1
"Anything before a Jesuit!”", 1
"He was beside himself.", 1
"“Oh, oh!”", 1
"“Eh, Padre—”", 1
"A general discussion broke out, regardless of the Captain-General.", 1
"All talked at once, they yelled, they misunderstood and contradicted one another.", 1
"Ben-Zayb and Padre Camorra shook their fists in each other’s faces, one talking of simpletons and the other of ink-slingers, Padre Sibyla kept harping on the Capitulum, and Padre Fernandez on the Summa of St. Thomas, until the curate of Los Baños entered to announce that breakfast was served.", 1
"His Excellency arose and so ended the discussion.", 1
"“Well, gentlemen,” he said, “we’ve worked like niggers and yet we’re on a vacation.", 1
"Some one has said that grave matters should be considered at dessert.", 1
"I’m entirely of that opinion.”", 1
"“We might get indigestion,” remarked the secretary, alluding to the heat of the discussion.", 3
"“Then we’ll lay it aside until tomorrow.”", 1
"As they rose the high official whispered to the General, “Your Excellency, the daughter of Cabesang Tales has been here again begging for the release of her sick grandfather, who was arrested in place of her father.”", 1
"His Excellency looked at him with an expression of impatience and rubbed his hand across his broad forehead.", 1
"“Carambas! Can’t one be left to eat his breakfast in peace?”", 1
"“This is the third day she has come.", 1
"She’s a poor girl—”", 1
"“Oh, the devil!” exclaimed Padre Camorra.", 1
"“I’ve just thought of it.", 1
"I have something to say to the General about that—that’s what I came over for—to support that girl’s petition.”", 1
"The General scratched the back of his ear and said, “Oh, go along!", 1
"Have the secretary make out an order to the lieutenant of the Civil Guard for the old man’s release.", 1
"They sha’n’t say that we’re not clement and merciful.”", 3
"He looked at Ben-Zayb.", 1
"The journalist winked.", 1
"Reluctantly, and almost with tearful eyes, Placido Penitente was going along the Escolta on his way to the University of Santo Tomas.", 1
"It had hardly been a week since he had come from his town, yet he had already written to his mother twice, reiterating his desire to abandon his studies and go back there to work.", 1
"His mother answered that he should have patience, that at the least he must be graduated as a bachelor of arts, since it would be unwise to desert his books after four years of expense and sacrifices on both their parts.", 1
"Whence came to Penitente this aversion to study, when he had been one of the most diligent in the famous college conducted by Padre Valerio in Tanawan?", 3
"There Penitente had been considered one of the best Latinists and the subtlest disputants, one who could tangle or untangle the simplest as well as the most abstruse questions.", 1
"His townspeople considered him very clever, and his curate, influenced by that opinion, already classified him as a filibuster—a sure proof that he was neither foolish nor incapable.", 3
"His friends could not explain those desires for abandoning his studies and returning: he had no sweethearts, was not a gambler, hardly knew anything about hunkían and rarely tried his luck at the more familiar revesino.", 1
"He did not believe in the advice of the curates, laughed at Tandang Basio Macunat, had plenty of money and good clothes, yet he went to school reluctantly and looked with repugnance on his books.", 1
"On the Bridge of Spain, a bridge whose name alone came from Spain, since even its ironwork came from foreign countries, he fell in with the long procession of young men on their way to the Walled City to their respective schools.", 3
"Some were dressed in the European fashion and walked rapidly, carrying books and notes, absorbed in thoughts of their lessons and essays—these were the students of the Ateneo.", 1
"Those from San Juan de Letran were nearly all dressed in the Filipino costume, but were more numerous and carried fewer books.", 1
"Those from the University are dressed more carefully and elegantly and saunter along carrying canes instead of books.", 1
"The collegians of the Philippines are not very noisy or turbulent.", 1
"They move along in a preoccupied manner, such that upon seeing them one would say that before their eyes shone no hope, no smiling future.", 1
"Placido was proceeding along the Paseo de Magallanes toward the breach—formerly the gate—of Santo Domingo, when he suddenly felt a slap on the shoulder, which made him turn quickly in ill humor.", 1
"“Hello, Penitente! Hello, Penitente!”", 1
"It was his schoolmate Juanito Pelaez, the barbero or pet of the professors, as big a rascal as he could be, with a roguish look and a clownish smile.", 3
"The son of a Spanish mestizo—a rich merchant in one of the suburbs, who based all his hopes and joys on the boy’s talent—he promised well with his roguery, and, thanks to his custom of playing tricks on every one and then hiding behind his companions, he had acquired a peculiar hump, which grew larger whenever he was laughing over his deviltry.", 1
"“What kind of time did you have, Penitente?” was his question as he again slapped him on the shoulder.", 1
"“So, so,” answered Placido, rather bored.", 1
"“And you?”", 1
"“Well, it was great!", 1
"Just imagine—the curate of Tiani invited me to spend the vacation in his town, and I went.", 1
"Old man, you know Padre Camorra, I suppose?", 1
"Well, he’s a liberal curate, very jolly, frank, very frank, one of those like Padre Paco.", 1
"As there were pretty girls, we serenaded them all, he with his guitar and songs and I with my violin.", 1
"I tell you, old man, we had a great time—there wasn’t a house we didn’t try!”", 1
"He whispered a few words in Placido’s ear and then broke out into laughter.", 1
"As the latter exhibited some surprise, he resumed: “I’ll swear to it!", 1
"They can’t help themselves, because with a governmental order you get rid of the father, husband, or brother, and then—merry Christmas!", 1
"However, we did run up against a little fool, the sweetheart, I believe, of Basilio, you know?", 1
"Look, what a fool this Basilio is!", 3
"To have a sweetheart who doesn’t know a word of Spanish, who hasn’t any money, and who has been a servant!", 1
"She’s as shy as she can be, but pretty.", 1
"Padre Camorra one night started to club two fellows who were serenading her and I don’t know how it was he didn’t kill them, yet with all that she was just as shy as ever.", 1
"But it’ll result for her as it does with all the women, all of them!”", 1
"Juanito Pelaez laughed with a full mouth, as though he thought this a glorious thing, while Placido stared at him in disgust.", 1
"“Listen, what did the professor explain yesterday?” asked Juanito, changing the conversation.", 1
"“Yesterday there was no class.”", 1
"“Oho, and the day before yesterday?”", 1
"“Man, it was Thursday!”", 1
"“Right! What an ass I am!", 3
"Don’t you know, Placido, that I’m getting to be a regular ass?", 3
"What about Wednesday?”", 1
"“Wednesday? Wait—Wednesday, it was a little wet.”", 1
"“Fine! What about Tuesday, old man?”", 1
"“Tuesday was the professor’s nameday and we went to entertain him with an orchestra, present him flowers and some gifts.”", 1
"“Ah, carambas!” exclaimed Juanito, “that I should have forgotten about it!", 1
"What an ass I am!", 3
"Listen, did he ask for me?”", 1
"Penitente shrugged his shoulders.", 1
"“I don’t know, but they gave him a list of his entertainers.”", 1
"“Carambas! Listen—Monday, what happened?”", 1
"“As it was the first school-day, he called the roll and assigned the lesson—about mirrors.", 1
"Look, from here to here, by memory, word for word.", 1
"We jump all this section, we take that.”", 1
"He was pointing out with his finger in the “Physics” the portions that were to be learned, when suddenly the book flew through the air, as a result of the slap Juanito gave it from below.", 1
"“Thunder, let the lessons go!", 1
"Let’s have a dia pichido!”", 1
"The students in Manila call dia pichido a school-day that falls between two holidays and is consequently suppressed, as though forced out by their wish.", 1
"“Do you know that you really are an ass?” exclaimed Placido, picking up his book and papers.", 3
"“Let’s have a dia pichido!” repeated Juanito.", 1
"Placido was unwilling, since for only two the authorities were hardly going to suspend a class of more than a hundred and fifty.", 1
"He recalled the struggles and privations his mother was suffering in order to keep him in Manila, while she went without even the necessities of life.", 1
"They were just passing through the breach of Santo Domingo, and Juanito, gazing across the little plaza [25] in front of the old Customs building, exclaimed, “Now I think of it, I’m appointed to take up the collection.”", 1
"“What collection?”", 1
"“For the monument.”", 1
"“What monument?”", 1
"“Get out! For Padre Balthazar, you know.”", 1
"“And who was Padre Balthazar?”", 1
"“Fool! A Dominican, of course—that’s why the padres call on the students.", 3
"Come on now, loosen up with three or four pesos, so that they may see we are sports.", 1
"Don’t let them say afterwards that in order to erect a statue they had to dig down into their own pockets.", 1
"Do, Placido, it’s not money thrown away.”", 3
"He accompanied these words with a significant wink.", 1
"Placido recalled the case of a student who had passed through the entire course by presenting canary-birds, so he subscribed three pesos.", 1
"“Look now, I’ll write your name plainly so that the professor will read it, you see—Placido Penitente, three pesos.", 1
"Ah, listen!", 1
"In a couple of weeks comes the nameday of the professor of natural history.", 1
"You know that he’s a good fellow, never marks absences or asks about the lesson.", 1
"Man, we must show our appreciation!”", 1
"“That’s right!”", 1
"“Then don’t you think that we ought to give him a celebration?", 1
"The orchestra must not be smaller than the one you had for the professor of physics.”", 1
"“That’s right!”", 1
"“What do you think about making the contribution two pesos?", 1
"Come, Placido, you start it, so you’ll be at the head of the list.”", 1
"Then, seeing that Placido gave the two pesos without hesitation, he added, “Listen, put up four, and afterwards I’ll return you two.", 1
"They’ll serve as a decoy.”", 1
"“Well, if you’re going to return them to me, why give them to you?", 1
"It’ll be sufficient, for you to write four.”", 1
"“Ah, that’s right!", 1
"What an ass I am!", 3
"Do you know, I’m getting to be a regular ass!", 3
"But let me have them anyhow, so that I can show them.”", 1
"Placido, in order not to give the lie to the priest who christened him, gave what was asked, just as they reached the University.", 3
"In the entrance and along the walks on each side of it were gathered the students, awaiting the appearance of the professors.", 1
"Students of the preparatory year of law, of the fifth of the secondary course, of the preparatory in medicine, formed lively groups.", 1
"The latter were easily distinguished by their clothing and by a certain air that was lacking in the others, since the greater part of them came from the Ateneo Municipal.", 1
"Among them could be seen the poet Isagani, explaining to a companion the theory of the refraction of light.", 1
"In another group they were talking, disputing, citing the statements of the professor, the text-books, and scholastic principles; in yet another they were gesticulating and waving their books in the air or making demonstrations with their canes by drawing diagrams on the ground; farther on, they were entertaining themselves in watching the pious women go into the neighboring church, all the students making facetious remarks.", 1
"An old woman leaning on a young girl limped piously, while the girl moved along with downcast eyes, timid and abashed to pass before so many curious eyes.", 1
"The old lady, catching up her coffee-colored skirt, of the Sisterhood of St. Rita, to reveal her big feet and white stockings, scolded her companion and shot furious glances at the staring bystanders.", 1
"“The rascals!” she grunted.", 1
"“Don’t look at them, keep your eyes down.”", 1
"Everything was noticed; everything called forth jokes and comments.", 1
"Soon there was noticed some movement in the groups, a certain air of expectancy, while Isagani paused and turned pale.", 1
"A carriage drawn by a pair of well-known white horses had stopped at the door.", 1
"It was that of Paulita Gomez, and she had already jumped down, light as a bird, without giving the rascals time to see her foot.", 1
"With a bewitching whirl of her body and a sweep of her hand she arranged the folds of her skirt, shot a rapid and apparently careless glance toward Isagani, spoke to him and smiled.", 1
"Doña Victorina descended in her turn, gazed over her spectacles, saw Juanito Pelaez, smiled, and bowed to him affably.", 1
"Isagani, flushed with excitement, returned a timid salute, while Juanito bowed profoundly, took off his hat, and made the same gesture as the celebrated clown and caricaturist Panza when he received applause.", 1
"“Heavens, what a girl!” exclaimed one of the students, starting forward.", 1
"“Tell the professor that I’m seriously ill.”", 1
"So Tadeo, as this invalid youth was known, entered the church to follow the girl.", 1
"Tadeo went to the University every day to ask if the classes would be held and each time seemed to be more and more astonished that they would.", 1
"He had a fixed idea of a latent and eternal holiday, and expected it to come any day.", 1
"So each morning, after vainly proposing that they play truant, he would go away alleging important business, an appointment, or illness, just at the very moment when his companions were going to their classes.", 1
"But by some occult, thaumaturgic art Tadeo passed the examinations, was beloved by the professors, and had before him a promising future.", 3
"Meanwhile, the groups began to move inside, for the professor of physics and chemistry had put in his appearance.", 1
"The students appeared to be cheated in their hopes and went toward the interior of the building with exclamations of discontent.", 1
"Placido went along with the crowd.", 1
"“Penitente, Penitente!” called a student with a certain mysterious air.", 1
"“Sign this!”", 1
"“What is it?”", 1
"“Never mind—sign it!”", 1
"It seemed to Placido that some one was twitching his ears.", 1
"He recalled the story of a cabeza de barangay in his town who, for having signed a document that he did not understand, was kept a prisoner for months and months, and came near to deportation.", 1
"An uncle of Placido’s, in order to fix the lesson in his memory, had given him a severe ear-pulling, so that always whenever he heard signatures spoken of, his ears reproduced the sensation.", 1
"“Excuse me, but I can’t sign anything without first understanding what it’s about.”", 1
"“What a fool you are!", 3
"If two celestial carbineers have signed it, what have you to fear?”", 3
"The name of celestial carbineers inspired confidence, being, as it was, a sacred company created to aid God in the warfare against the evil spirit and to prevent the smuggling of heretical contraband into the markets of the New Zion.", 1
"Placido was about to sign to make an end of it, because he was in a hurry,—already his classmates were reciting the O Thoma,—but again his ears twitched, so he said, “After the class!", 1
"I want to read it first.”", 1
"“It’s very long, don’t you see?", 1
"It concerns the presentation of a counter-petition, or rather, a protest.", 1
"Don’t you understand?", 1
"Makaraig and some others have asked that an academy of Castilian be opened, which is a piece of genuine foolishness—”", 1
"“All right, all right, after awhile.", 1
"They’re already beginning,” answered Placido, trying to get away.", 1
"“But your professor may not call the roll—”", 1
"“Yes, yes; but he calls it sometimes.", 1
"Later on, later on!", 1
"Besides, I don’t want to put myself in opposition to Makaraig.”", 1
"“But it’s not putting yourself in opposition, it’s only—”", 1
"Placido heard no more, for he was already far away, hurrying to his class.", 1
"He heard the different voices—adsum, adsum—the roll was being called!", 1
"Hastening his steps he got to the door just as the letter Q was reached.", 1
"“Tinamáan ñg—!” [28] he muttered, biting his lips.", 1
"He hesitated about entering, for the mark was already down against him and was not to be erased.", 1
"One did not go to the class to learn but in order not to get this absence mark, for the class was reduced to reciting the lesson from memory, reading the book, and at the most answering a few abstract, profound, captious, enigmatic questions.", 1
"True, the usual preachment was never lacking—the same as ever, about humility, submission, and respect to the clerics, and he, Placido, was humble, submissive, and respectful.", 1
"So he was about to turn away when he remembered that the examinations were approaching and his professor had not yet asked him a question nor appeared to notice him—this would be a good opportunity to attract his attention and become known!", 1
"To be known was to gain a year, for if it cost nothing to suspend one who was not known, it required a hard heart not to be touched by the sight of a youth who by his daily presence was a reproach over a year of his life wasted.", 3
"So Placido went in, not on tiptoe as was his custom, but noisily on his heels, and only too well did he succeed in his intent!", 1
"The professor stared at him, knitted his brows, and shook his head, as though to say, “Ah, little impudence, you’ll pay for that!”", 3
"The classroom was a spacious rectangular hall with large grated windows that admitted an abundance of light and air.", 1
"Along the two sides extended three wide tiers of stone covered with wood, filled with students arranged in alphabetical order.", 1
"At the end opposite the entrance, under a print of St. Thomas Aquinas, rose the professor’s chair on an elevated platform with a little stairway on each side.", 1
"With the exception of a beautiful blackboard in a narra frame, scarcely ever used, since there was still written on it the viva that had appeared on the opening day, no furniture, either useful or useless, was to be seen.", 1
"The walls, painted white and covered with glazed tiles to prevent scratches, were entirely bare, having neither a drawing nor a picture, nor even an outline of any physical apparatus.", 1
"The students had no need of any, no one missed the practical instruction in an extremely experimental science; for years and years it has been so taught and the country has not been upset, but continues just as ever.", 3
"Now and then some little instrument descended from heaven and was exhibited to the class from a distance, like the monstrance to the prostrate worshipers—look, but touch not!", 3
"From time to time, when some complacent professor appeared, one day in the year was set aside for visiting the mysterious laboratory and gazing from without at the puzzling apparatus arranged in glass cases.", 1
"No one could complain, for on that day there were to be seen quantities of brass and glassware, tubes, disks, wheels, bells, and the like—the exhibition did not get beyond that, and the country was not upset.", 1
"Besides, the students were convinced that those instruments had not been purchased for them—the friars would be fools!", 3
"The laboratory was intended to be shown to the visitors and the high officials who came from the Peninsula, so that upon seeing it they would nod their heads with satisfaction, while their guide would smile, as if to say, “Eh, you thought you were going to find some backward monks!", 3
"Well, we’re right up with the times—we have a laboratory!”", 3
"The visitors and high officials, after being handsomely entertained, would then write in their Travels or Memoirs: “The Royal and Pontifical University of Santo Tomas of Manila, in charge of the enlightened Dominican Order, possesses a magnificent physical laboratory for the instruction of youth.", 1
"Some two hundred and fifty students annually study this subject, but whether from apathy, indolence, the limited capacity of the Indian, or some other ethnological or incomprehensible reason, up to now there has not developed a Lavoisier, a Secchi, or a Tyndall, not even in miniature, in the Malay-Filipino race.”", 1
"Yet, to be exact, we will say that in this laboratory are held the classes of thirty or forty advanced students, under the direction of an instructor who performs his duties well enough, but as the greater part of these students come from the Ateneo of the Jesuits, where science is taught practically in the laboratory itself, its utility does not come to be so great as it would be if it could be utilized by the two hundred and fifty who pay their matriculation fees, buy their books, memorize them, and waste a year to know nothing afterwards.", 1
"As a result, with the exception of some rare usher or janitor who has had charge of the museum for years, no one has ever been known to get any advantage from the lessons memorized with so great effort.", 1
"But let us return to the class.", 1
"The professor was a young Dominican, who had filled several chairs in San Juan de Letran with zeal and good repute.", 1
"He had the reputation of being a great logician as well as a profound philosopher, and was one of the most promising in his clique.", 1
"His elders treated him with consideration, while the younger men envied him, for there were also cliques among them.", 1
"This was the third year of his professorship and, although the first in which he had taught physics and chemistry, he already passed for a sage, not only with the complaisant students but also among the other nomadic professors.", 1
"Padre Millon did not belong to the common crowd who each year change their subject in order to acquire scientific knowledge, students among other students, with the difference only that they follow a single course, that they quiz instead of being quizzed, that they have a better knowledge of Castilian, and that they are not examined at the completion of the course.", 1
"Padre Millon went deeply into science, knew the physics of Aristotle and Padre Amat, read carefully his “Ramos,” and sometimes glanced at “Ganot.”", 1
"Moreover, in spite of having been an instructor in geography, he still entertained certain doubts as to the rotundity of the earth and smiled maliciously when its rotation and revolution around the sun were mentioned, as he recited the verses", 1
"He also smiled maliciously in the presence of certain physical theories and considered visionary, if not actually insane, the Jesuit Secchi, to whom he imputed the making of triangulations on the host as a result of his astronomical mania, for which reason it was said that he had been forbidden to celebrate mass.", 1
"Many persons also noticed in him some aversion to the sciences that he taught, but these vagaries were trifles, scholarly and religious prejudices that were easily explained, not only by the fact that the physical sciences were eminently practical, of pure observation and deduction, while his forte was philosophy, purely speculative, of abstraction and induction, but also because, like any good Dominican, jealous of the fame of his order, he could hardly feel any affection for a science in which none of his brethren had excelled—he was the first who did not accept the chemistry of St. Thomas Aquinas—and in which so much renown had been acquired by hostile, or rather, let us say, rival orders.", 1
"This was the professor who that morning called the roll and directed many of the students to recite the lesson from memory, word for word.", 1
"The phonographs got into operation, some well, some ill, some stammering, and received their grades.", 1
"He who recited without an error earned a good mark and he who made more than three mistakes a bad mark.", 1
"A fat boy with a sleepy face and hair as stiff and hard as the bristles of a brush yawned until he seemed to be about to dislocate his jaws, and stretched himself with his arms extended as though he were in his bed.", 1
"The professor saw this and wished to startle him.", 1
"“Eh, there, sleepy-head! What’s this?", 1
"Lazy, too, so it’s sure you [30] don’t know the lesson, ha?”", 1
"Padre Millon not only used the depreciative tu with the students, like a good friar, but he also addressed them in the slang of the markets, a practise that he had acquired from the professor of canonical law: whether that reverend gentleman wished to humble the students or the sacred decrees of the councils is a question not yet settled, in spite of the great attention that has been given to it.", 3
"This question, instead of offending the class, amused them, and many laughed—it was a daily occurrence.", 1
"But the sleeper did not laugh; he arose with a bound, rubbed his eyes, and, as though a steam-engine were turning the phonograph, began to recite.", 1
"“Stop, stop, stop!” interrupted the professor.", 1
"“Heavens, what a rattle!", 1
"We are at the point where the mirrors are divided into metallic and glass, eh?", 1
"Now if I should present to you a block of wood, a piece of kamagon for instance, well polished and varnished, or a slab of black marble well burnished, or a square of jet, which would reflect the images of objects placed before them, how would you classify those mirrors?”", 1
"Whether he did not know what to answer or did not understand the question, the student tried to get out of the difficulty by demonstrating that he knew the lesson, so he rushed on like a torrent.", 1
"“Tut, tut, tut! That’s not it!", 1
"I say to you ‘Dominus vobiscum,’ and you answer me with ‘Requiescat in pace!’", 3
"The worthy professor then repeated the question in the vernacular of the markets, interspersed with cosas and abás at every moment.", 1
"The poor youth did not know how to get out of the quandary: he doubted whether to include the kamagon with the metals, or the marble with glasses, and leave the jet as a neutral substance, until Juanito Pelaez maliciously prompted him:", 1
"“The mirror of kamagon among the wooden mirrors.”", 1
"The incautious youth repeated this aloud and half the class was convulsed with laughter.", 1
"“A good sample of wood you are yourself!” exclaimed the professor, laughing in spite of himself.", 3
"Let’s see from what you would define a mirror—from a surface per se, in quantum est superficies, or from a substance that forms the surface, or from the substance upon which the surface rests, the raw material, modified by the attribute ‘surface,’ since it is clear that, surface being an accidental property of bodies, it cannot exist without substance.", 1
"Let’s see now—what do you say?”", 1
"“I? Nothing!” the wretched boy was about to reply, for he did not understand what it was all about, confused as he was by so many surfaces and so many accidents that smote cruelly on his ears, but a sense of shame restrained him.", 1
"Filled with anguish and breaking into a cold perspiration, he began to repeat between his teeth: “The name of mirror is applied to all polished surfaces—”", 1
"“Ergo, per te, the mirror is the surface,” angled the professor.", 1
"“Well, then, clear up this difficulty.", 1
"If the surface is the mirror, it must be of no consequence to the ‘essence’ of the mirror what may be found behind this surface, since what is behind it does not affect the ‘essence’ that is before it, id est, the surface, quae super faciem est, quia vocatur superficies, facies ea quae supra videtur.", 1
"Do you admit that or do you not admit it?”", 1
"The poor youth’s hair stood up straighter than ever, as though acted upon by some magnetic force.", 1
"“Do you admit it or do you not admit it?”", 1
"“Anything! Whatever you wish, Padre,” was his thought, but he did not dare to express it from fear of ridicule.", 1
"That was a dilemma indeed, and he had never been in a worse one.", 1
"He had a vague idea that the most innocent thing could not be admitted to the friars but that they, or rather their estates and curacies, would get out of it all the results and advantages imaginable.", 1
"So his good angel prompted him to deny everything with all the energy of his soul and refractoriness of his hair, and he was about to shout a proud nego, for the reason that he who denies everything does not compromise himself in anything, as a certain lawyer had once told him; but the evil habit of disregarding the dictates of one’s own conscience, of having little faith in legal folk, and of seeking aid from others where one is sufficient unto himself, was his undoing.", 1
"His companions, especially Juanito Pelaez, were making signs to him to admit it, so he let himself be carried away by his evil destiny and exclaimed, “Concedo, Padre,” in a voice as faltering as though he were saying, “In manus tuas commendo spiritum meum.”", 1
"“Concedo antecedentum,” echoed the professor, smiling maliciously.", 1
"“Ergo, I can scratch the mercury off a looking-glass, put in its place a piece of bibinka, and we shall still have a mirror, eh?", 1
"Now what shall we have?”", 1
"The youth gazed at his prompters, but seeing them surprised and speechless, contracted his features into an expression of bitterest reproach.", 1
"Vainly he coughed, fumbled at his shirt-bosom, stood first on one foot and then on the other, but found no answer.", 1
"“Come now, what have we?” urged the professor, enjoying the effect of his reasoning.", 1
"“Bibinka!” whispered Juanito Pelaez.", 1
"“Bibinka!”", 1
"“Shut up, you fool!” cried the desperate youth, hoping to get out of the difficulty by turning it into a complaint.", 3
"“Let’s see, Juanito, if you can answer the question for me,” the professor then said to Pelaez, who was one of his pets.", 1
"The latter rose slowly, not without first giving Penitente, who followed him on the roll, a nudge that meant, “Don’t forget to prompt me.”", 1
"“Nego consequentiam, Padre,” he replied resolutely.", 1
"“Aha, then probo consequentiam!", 1
"Per te, the polished surface constitutes the ‘essence’ of the mirror—”", 1
"“Nego suppositum!” interrupted Juanito, as he felt Placido pulling at his coat.", 1
"“How? Per te—”", 1
"“Nego!”", 1
"“Ergo, you believe that what is behind affects what is in front?”", 1
"“Nego!” the student cried with still more ardor, feeling another jerk at his coat.", 1
"Juanito, or rather Placido, who was prompting him, was unconsciously adopting Chinese tactics: not to admit the most inoffensive foreigner in order not to be invaded.", 1
"“Then where are we?” asked the professor, somewhat disconcerted, and looking uneasily at the refractory student.", 1
"“Does the substance behind affect, or does it not affect, the surface?”", 1
"To this precise and categorical question, a kind of ultimatum, Juanito did not know what to reply and his coat offered no suggestions.", 1
"In vain he made signs to Placido, but Placido himself was in doubt.", 1
"Juanito then took advantage of a moment in which the professor was staring at a student who was cautiously and secretly taking off the shoes that hurt his feet, to step heavily on Placido’s toes and whisper, “Tell me, hurry up, tell me!”", 1
"The professor heard the cry, stared at the pair, and guessed what had happened.", 1
"“Listen, you meddler,” he addressed Placido, “I wasn’t questioning you, but since you think you can save others, let’s see if you can save yourself, salva te ipsum, and decide this question.”", 1
"Juanito sat down in content, and as a mark of gratitude stuck out his tongue at his prompter, who had arisen blushing with shame and muttering incoherent excuses.", 1
"For a moment Padre Millon regarded him as one gloating over a favorite dish.", 1
"What a good thing it would be to humiliate and hold up to ridicule that dudish boy, always smartly dressed, with head erect and serene look!", 3
"It would be a deed of charity, so the charitable professor applied himself to it with all his heart, slowly repeating the question.", 3
"“The book says that the metallic mirrors are made of brass and an alloy of different metals—is that true or is it not true?”", 1
"“So the book says, Padre.”", 1
"“Liber dixit, ergo ita est.", 1
"Don’t pretend that you know more than the book does.", 3
"It then adds that the glass mirrors are made of a sheet of glass whose two surfaces are well polished, one of them having applied to it an amalgam of tin, nota bene, an amalgam of tin!", 1
"Is that true?”", 1
"“If the book says so, Padre.”", 1
"“Is tin a metal?”", 1
"“It seems so, Padre.", 1
"The book says so.”", 1
"“It is, it is, and the word amalgam means that it is compounded with mercury, which is also a metal.", 1
"Ergo, a glass mirror is a metallic mirror; ergo, the terms of the distinction are confused; ergo, the classification is imperfect—how do you explain that, meddler?”", 1
"He emphasized the ergos and the familiar “you’s” with indescribable relish, at the same time winking, as though to say, “You’re done for.”", 1
"“It means that, it means that—” stammered Placido.", 1
"“It means that you haven’t learned the lesson, you petty meddler, you don’t understand it yourself, and yet you prompt your neighbor!”", 1
"The class took no offense, but on the contrary many thought the epithet funny and laughed.", 1
"Placido bit his lips.", 1
"“What’s your name?” the professor asked him.", 1
"“Placido,” was the curt reply.", 1
"“Aha! Placido Penitente, although you look more like Placido the Prompter—or the Prompted.", 3
"But, Penitent, I’m going to impose some penance on you for your promptings.”", 3
"Pleased with his play on words, he ordered the youth to recite the lesson, and the latter, in the state of mind to which he was reduced, made more than three mistakes.", 1
"Shaking his head up and down, the professor slowly opened the register and slowly scanned it while he called off the names in a low voice.", 1
"“Palencia—Palomo—Panganiban—Pedraza—Pelado—Pelaez—Penitents, aha! Placido Penitente, fifteen unexcused absences—”", 1
"Placido started up.", 1
"“Fifteen absences, Padre?”", 1
"“Fifteen unexcused absences,” continued the professor, “so that you only lack one to be dropped from the roll.”", 1
"“Fifteen absences, fifteen absences,” repeated Placido in amazement.", 1
"“I’ve never been absent more than four times, and with today, perhaps five.”", 1
"“Jesso, jesso, monseer,” [31] replied the professor, examining the youth over his gold eye-glasses.", 1
"“You confess that you have missed five times, and God knows if you may have missed oftener.", 1
"Atqui, as I rarely call the roll, every time I catch any one I put five marks against him; ergo, how many are five times five?", 1
"Have you forgotten the multiplication table?", 1
"Five times five?”", 1
"“Twenty-five.”", 1
"“Correct, correct!", 1
"Thus you’ve still got away with ten, because I have caught you only three times.", 1
"Huh, if I had caught you every time—Now, how many are three times five?”", 1
"“Fifteen.”", 1
"“Fifteen, right you are!” concluded the professor, closing the register.", 1
"“If you miss once more—out of doors with you, get out!", 1
"Ah, now a mark for the failure in the daily lesson.”", 1
"He again opened the register, sought out the name, and entered the mark.", 1
"“Come, only one mark,” he said, “since you hadn’t any before.”", 1
"“But, Padre,” exclaimed Placido, restraining himself, “if your Reverence puts a mark against me for failing in the lesson, your Reverence owes it to me to erase the one for absence that you have put against me for today.”", 1
"His Reverence made no answer.", 1
"First he slowly entered the mark, then contemplated it with his head on one side,—the mark must be artistic,—closed the register, and asked with great sarcasm, “Abá, and why so, sir?”", 1
"“Because I can’t conceive, Padre, how one can be absent from the class and at the same time recite the lesson in it.", 1
"Your Reverence is saying that to be is not to be.”", 1
"“Nakú, a metaphysician, but a rather premature one!", 3
"So you can’t conceive of it, eh?", 3
"Sed patet experientia and contra experientiam negantem, fusilibus est arguendum, do you understand?", 1
"And can’t you conceive, with your philosophical head, that one can be absent from the class and not know the lesson at the same time?", 1
"Is it a fact that absence necessarily implies knowledge?", 3
"What do you say to that, philosophaster?”", 1
"This last epithet was the drop of water that made the full cup overflow.", 1
"Placido enjoyed among his friends the reputation of being a philosopher, so he lost his patience, threw down his book, arose, and faced the professor.", 1
"“Enough, Padre, enough!", 1
"Your Reverence can put all the marks against me that you wish, but you haven’t the right to insult me.", 1
"Your Reverence may stay with the class, I can’t stand any more.”", 1
"Without further farewell, he stalked away.", 1
"The class was astounded; such an assumption of dignity had scarcely ever been seen, and who would have thought it of Placido Penitente?", 3
"The surprised professor bit his lips and shook his head threateningly as he watched him depart.", 1
"Then in a trembling voice he began his preachment on the same old theme, delivered however with more energy and more eloquence.", 1
"It dealt with the growing arrogance, the innate ingratitude, the presumption, the lack of respect for superiors, the pride that the spirit of darkness infused in the young, the lack of manners, the absence of courtesy, and so on.", 1
"From this he passed to coarse jests and sarcasm over the presumption which some good-for-nothing “prompters” had of teaching their teachers by establishing an academy for instruction in Castilian.", 1
"“Aha, aha!” he moralized, “those who the day before yesterday scarcely knew how to say, ‘Yes, Padre,’ ‘No, Padre,’ now want to know more than those who have grown gray teaching them.", 1
"He who wishes to learn, will learn, academies or no academies!", 3
"Undoubtedly that fellow who has just gone out is one of those in the project.", 1
"Castilian is in good hands with such guardians!", 3
"When are you going to get the time to attend the academy if you have scarcely enough to fulfill your duties in the regular classes?", 1
"We wish that you may all know Spanish and that you pronounce it well, so that you won’t split our ear-drums with your twist of expression and your ‘p’s’; [32] but first business and then pleasure: finish your studies first, and afterwards learn Castilian, and all become clerks, if you so wish.”", 1
"So he went on with his harangue until the bell rang and the class was over.", 1
"The two hundred and thirty-four students, after reciting their prayers, went out as ignorant as when they went in, but breathing more freely, as if a great weight had been lifted from them.", 1
"Each youth had lost another hour of his life and with it a portion of his dignity and self-respect, and in exchange there was an increase of discontent, of aversion to study, of resentment in their hearts.", 1
"After all this ask for knowledge, dignity, gratitude!", 3
"De nobis, post haec, tristis sententia fertur!", 1
"The house where Makaraig lived was worth visiting.", 1
"Large and spacious, with two entresols provided with elegant gratings, it seemed to be a school during the first hours of the morning and pandemonium from ten o’clock on.", 1
"During the boarders’ recreation hours, from the lower hallway of the spacious entrance up to the main floor, there was a bubbling of laughter, shouts, and movement.", 1
"Boys in scanty clothing played sipa or practised gymnastic exercises on improvised trapezes, while on the staircase a fight was in progress between eight or nine armed with canes, sticks, and ropes, but neither attackers nor attacked did any great damage, their blows generally falling sidewise upon the shoulders of the Chinese pedler who was there selling his outlandish mixtures and indigestible pastries.", 1
"Crowds of boys surrounded him, pulled at his already disordered queue, snatched pies from him, haggled over the prices, and committed a thousand deviltries.", 1
"The Chinese yelled, swore, forswore, in all the languages he could jabber, not omitting his own; he whimpered, laughed, pleaded, put on a smiling face when an ugly one would not serve, or the reverse.", 1
"Concerts on the piano and violin, the guitar, and the accordion, alternated with the continual clashing of blades from the fencing lessons.", 1
"Around a long, wide table the students of the Ateneo prepared their compositions or solved their problems by the side of others writing to their sweethearts on pink perforated note-paper covered with drawings.", 1
"Here one was composing a melodrama at the side of another practising on the flute, from which he drew wheezy notes.", 1
"Over there, the older boys, students in professional courses, who affected silk socks and embroidered slippers, amused themselves in teasing the smaller boys by pulling their ears, already red from repeated fillips, while two or three held down a little fellow who yelled and cried, defending himself with his feet against being reduced to the condition in which he was born, kicking and howling.", 1
"In one room, around a small table, four were playing revesino with laughter and jokes, to the great annoyance of another who pretended to be studying his lesson but who was in reality waiting his turn to play.", 1
"Still another came in with exaggerated wonder, scandalized as he approached the table.", 1
"“How wicked you are!", 1
"So early in the morning and already gambling!", 1
"Let’s see, let’s see!", 1
"You fool, take it with the three of spades!”", 1
"Closing his book, he too joined in the game.", 1
"Cries and blows were heard.", 1
"Two boys were fighting in the adjoining room—a lame student who was very sensitive about his infirmity and an unhappy newcomer from the provinces who was just commencing his studies.", 1
"He was working over a treatise on philosophy and reading innocently in a loud voice, with a wrong accent, the Cartesian principle: “Cogito, ergo sum!”", 1
"The little lame boy (el cojito) took this as an insult and the others intervened to restore peace, but in reality only to sow discord and come to blows themselves.", 3
"In the dining-room a young man with a can of sardines, a bottle of wine, and the provisions that he had just brought from his town, was making heroic efforts to the end that his friends might participate in his lunch, while they were offering in their turn heroic resistance to his invitation.", 1
"Others were bathing on the azotea, playing firemen with the water from the well, and joining in combats with pails of water, to the great delight of the spectators.", 1
"But the noise and shouts gradually died away with the coming of leading students, summoned by Makaraig to report to them the progress of the academy of Castilian.", 1
"Isagani was cordially greeted, as was also the Peninsular, Sandoval, who had come to Manila as a government employee and was finishing his studies, and who had completely identified himself with the cause of the Filipino students.", 1
"The barriers that politics had established between the races had disappeared in the schoolroom as though dissolved by the zeal of science and youth.", 1
"From lack of lyceums and scientific, literary, or political centers, Sandoval took advantage of all the meetings to cultivate his great oratorical gifts, delivering speeches and arguing on any subject, to draw forth applause from his friends and listeners.", 1
"At that moment the subject of conversation was the instruction in Castilian, but as Makaraig had not yet arrived conjecture was still the order of the day.", 1
"“What can have happened?”", 3
"“What has the General decided?”", 3
"“Has he refused the permit?”", 3
"“Has Padre Irene or Padre Sibyla won?”", 3
"Such were the questions they asked one another, questions that could be answered only by Makaraig.", 1
"Among the young men gathered together there were optimists like Isagani and Sandoval, who saw the thing already accomplished and talked of congratulations and praise from the government for the patriotism of the students—outbursts of optimism that led Juanito Pelaez to claim for himself a large part of the glory of founding the society.", 1
"All this was answered by the pessimist Pecson, a chubby youth with a wide, clownish grin, who spoke of outside influences, whether the Bishop A., the Padre B., or the Provincial C., had been consulted or not, whether or not they had advised that the whole association should be put in jail—a suggestion that made Juanito Pelaez so uneasy that he stammered out, “Carambas, don’t you drag me into—”", 1
"Sandoval, as a Peninsular and a liberal, became furious at this.", 1
"“But pshaw!” he exclaimed, “that is holding a bad opinion of his Excellency!", 1
"I know that he’s quite a friar-lover, but in such a matter as this he won’t let the friars interfere.", 1
"Will you tell me, Pecson, on what you base your belief that the General has no judgment of his own?”", 1
"“I didn’t say that, Sandoval,” replied Pecson, grinning until he exposed his wisdom-tooth.", 1
"“For me the General has his own judgment, that is, the judgment of all those within his reach.", 3
"That’s plain!”", 3
"“You’re dodging—cite me a fact, cite me a fact!” cried Sandoval.", 1
"“Let’s get away from hollow arguments, from empty phrases, and get on the solid ground of facts,”—this with an elegant gesture.", 1
"Facts, gentlemen, facts!", 1
"The rest is prejudice—I won’t call it filibusterism.”", 1
"Pecson smiled like one of the blessed as he retorted, “There comes the filibusterism.", 1
"But can’t we enter into a discussion without resorting to accusations?”", 1
"Sandoval protested in a little extemporaneous speech, again demanding facts.", 1
"“Well, not long ago there was a dispute between some private persons and certain friars, and the acting Governor rendered a decision that it should be settled by the Provincial of the Order concerned,” replied Pecson, again breaking out into a laugh, as though he were dealing with an insignificant matter, he cited names and dates, and promised documents that would prove how justice was dispensed.", 1
"“But, on what ground, tell me this, on what ground can they refuse permission for what plainly appears to be extremely useful and necessary?” asked Sandoval.", 1
"Pecson shrugged his shoulders.", 1
"“It’s that it endangers the integrity of the fatherland,” he replied in the tone of a notary reading an allegation.", 3
"“That’s pretty good!", 3
"What has the integrity of the fatherland to do with the rules of syntax?”", 3
"“The Holy Mother Church has learned doctors—what do I know?", 3
"Perhaps it is feared that we may come to understand the laws so that we can obey them.", 3
"What will become of the Philippines on the day when we understand one another?”", 3
"Sandoval did not relish the dialectic and jesting turn of the conversation; along that path could rise no speech worth the while.", 1
"“Don’t make a joke of things!” he exclaimed.", 1
"“This is a serious matter.”", 1
"“The Lord deliver me from joking when there are friars concerned!”", 3
"“But, on what do you base—”", 1
"“On the fact that, the hours for the classes having to come at night,” continued Pecson in the same tone, as if he were quoting known and recognized formulas, “there may be invoked as an obstacle the immorality of the thing, as was done in the case of the school at Malolos.”", 1
"“Another! But don’t the classes of the Academy of Drawing, and the novenaries and the processions, cover themselves with the mantle of night?”", 1
"“The scheme affects the dignity of the University,” went on the chubby youth, taking no notice of the question.", 3
"“Affects nothing!", 1
"The University has to accommodate itself to the needs of the students.", 1
"And granting that, what is a university then?", 3
"Is it an institution to discourage study?", 3
"Have a few men banded themselves together in the name of learning and instruction in order to prevent others from becoming enlightened?”", 3
"“The fact is that movements initiated from below are regarded as discontent—”", 1
"“What about projects that come from above?” interpolated one of the students.", 3
"“There’s the School of Arts and Trades!”", 1
"“Slowly, slowly, gentlemen,” protested Sandoval.", 1
"“I’m not a friar-lover, my liberal views being well known, but render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s.", 1
"“Get out!” cried Sandoval, enraged at the interruption, which had caused him to lose the thread of his long, well-rounded sentence.", 1
"“As long as we hear nothing bad, let’s not be pessimists, let’s not be unjust, doubting the liberty and independence of the government.”", 1
"Here he entered upon a defense in beautiful phraseology of the government and its good intentions, a subject that Pecson dared not break in upon.", 1
"“The Spanish government,” he said among other things, “has given you everything, it has denied you nothing!", 1
"We had absolutism in Spain and you had absolutism here; the friars covered our soil with conventos, and conventos occupy a third part of Manila; in Spain the garrote prevails and here the garrote is the extreme punishment; we are Catholics and we have made you Catholics; we were scholastics and scholasticism sheds its light in your college halls; in short, gentlemen, we weep when you weep, we suffer when you suffer, we have the same altars, the same courts, the same punishments, and it is only just that we should give you our rights and our joys.”", 1
"As no one interrupted him, he became more and more enthusiastic, until he came to speak of the future of the Philippines.", 1
"“As I have said, gentlemen, the dawn is not far distant.", 1
"Spain is now breaking the eastern sky for her beloved Philippines, and the times are changing, as I positively know, faster than we imagine.", 1
"This government, which, according to you, is vacillating and weak, should be strengthened by our confidence, that we may make it see that it is the custodian of our hopes.", 1
"Let us remind it by our conduct (should it ever forget itself, which I do not believe can happen) that we have faith in its good intentions and that it should be guided by no other standard than justice and the welfare of all the governed.", 1
"No, gentlemen,” he went on in a tone more and more declamatory, “we must not admit at all in this matter the possibility of a consultation with other more or less hostile entities, as such a supposition would imply our resignation to the fact.", 1
"Your conduct up to the present has been frank, loyal, without vacillation, above suspicion; you have addressed it simply and directly; the reasons you have presented could not be more sound; your aim is to lighten the labor of the teachers in the first years and to facilitate study among the hundreds of students who fill the college halls and for whom one solitary professor cannot suffice.", 1
"If up to the present the petition has not been granted, it has been for the reason, as I feel sure, that there has been a great deal of material accumulated, but I predict that the campaign is won, that the summons of Makaraig is to announce to us the victory, and tomorrow we shall see our efforts crowned with the applause and appreciation of the country, and who knows, gentlemen, but that the government may confer upon you some handsome decoration of merit, benefactors as you are of the fatherland!”", 1
"Enthusiastic applause resounded.", 1
"All immediately believed in the triumph, and many in the decoration.", 1
"“Let it be remembered, gentlemen,” observed Juanito, “that I was one of the first to propose it.”", 1
"The pessimist Pecson was not so enthusiastic.", 1
"“Just so we don’t get that decoration on our ankles,” he remarked, but fortunately for Pelaez this comment was not heard in the midst of the applause.", 3
"When they had quieted down a little, Pecson replied, “Good, good, very good, but one supposition: if in spite of all that, the General consults and consults and consults, and afterwards refuses the permit?”", 1
"This question fell like a dash of cold water.", 1
"All turned to Sandoval, who was taken aback.", 1
"“Then—” he stammered.", 1
"“Then?”", 1
"“Then,” he exclaimed in a burst of enthusiasm, still excited by the applause, “seeing that in writing and in printing it boasts of desiring your enlightenment, and yet hinders and denies it when called upon to make it a reality—then, gentlemen, your efforts will not have been in vain, you will have accomplished what no one else has been able to do.", 1
"Make them drop the mask and fling down the gauntlet to you!”", 1
"“Bravo, bravo!” cried several enthusiastically.", 1
"“Good for Sandoval!", 1
"Hurrah for the gauntlet!” added others.", 1
"“Let them fling down the gauntlet to us!” repeated Pecson disdainfully.", 1
"“But afterwards?”", 1
"Sandoval seemed to be cut short in his triumph, but with the vivacity peculiar to his race and his oratorical temperament he had an immediate reply.", 1
"“Afterwards?” he asked.", 1
"“Afterwards, if none of the Filipinos dare to accept the challenge, then I, Sandoval, in the name of Spain, will take up the gauntlet, because such a policy would give the lie to the good intentions that she has always cherished toward her provinces, and because he who is thus faithless to the trust reposed in him and abuses his unlimited authority deserves neither the protection of the fatherland nor the support of any Spanish citizen!”", 1
"The enthusiasm of his hearers broke all bounds.", 1
"Isagani embraced him, the others following his example.", 1
"They talked of the fatherland, of union, of fraternity, of fidelity.", 1
"The Filipinos declared that if there were only Sandovals in Spain all would be Sandovals in the Philippines.", 1
"His eyes glistened, and it might well be believed that if at that moment any kind of gauntlet had been flung at him he would have leaped upon any kind of horse to ride to death for the Philippines.", 1
"The “cold water” alone replied: “Good, that’s very good, Sandoval.", 3

"The bearer of such good news was Makaraig, the young man at the head of the movement.", 1
"This student occupied in that house, by himself, two rooms, luxuriously furnished, and had his servant and a cochero to look after his carriage and horses.", 1
"He was of robust carriage, of refined manners, fastidiously dressed, and very rich.", 1
"Although studying law only that he might have an academic degree, he enjoyed a reputation for diligence, and as a logician in the scholastic way had no cause to envy the most frenzied quibblers of the University faculty.", 1
"Nevertheless he was not very far behind in regard to modern ideas and progress, for his fortune enabled him to have all the books and magazines that a watchful censor was unable to keep out.", 1
"With these qualifications and his reputation for courage, his fortunate associations in his earlier years, and his refined and delicate courtesy, it was not strange that he should exercise such great influence over his associates and that he should have been chosen to carry out such a difficult undertaking as that of the instruction in Castilian.", 1
"After the first outburst of enthusiasm, which in youth always takes hold in such exaggerated forms, since youth finds everything beautiful, they wanted to be informed how the affair had been managed.", 1
"“I saw Padre Irene this morning,” said Makaraig with a certain air of mystery.", 1
"“Hurrah for Padre Irene!” cried an enthusiastic student.", 1
"“Padre Irene,” continued Makaraig, “has told me about everything that took place at Los Baños.", 1
"It seems that they disputed for at least a week, he supporting and defending our case against all of them, against Padre Sibyla, Padre Fernandez, Padre Salvi, the General, the jeweler Simoun—”", 1
"“The jeweler Simoun!” interrupted one of his listeners.", 1
"“What has that Jew to do with the affairs of our country?", 3
"We enrich him by buying—”", 1

"“Quiroga the Chinaman!", 1
"The pimp of the—”", 1
"“Shut up!”", 1
"“At last,” resumed Makaraig, “they were going to pigeonhole the petition and let it sleep for months and months, when Padre Irene remembered the Superior Commission of Primary Instruction and proposed, since the matter concerned the teaching of the Castilian tongue, that the petition be referred to that body for a report upon it.”", 1
"“But that Commission hasn’t been in operation for a long time,” observed Pecson.", 1
"“That’s exactly what they replied to Padre Irene, and he answered that this was a good opportunity to revive it, and availing himself of the presence of Don Custodio, one of its members, he proposed on the spot that a committee should be appointed.", 1
"Don Custodio’s activity being known and recognized, he was named as arbiter and the petition is now in his hands.", 1
"He promised that he would settle it this month.”", 1
"“Hurrah for Don Custodio!”", 1
"“But suppose Don Custodio should report unfavorably upon it?” inquired the pessimist Pecson.", 1
"Upon this they had not reckoned, being intoxicated with the thought that the matter would not be pigeonholed, so they all turned to Makaraig to learn how it could be arranged.", 1
"“The same objection I presented to Padre Irene, but with his sly smile he said to me: ‘We’ve won a great deal, we have succeeded in getting the matter on the road to a decision, the opposition sees itself forced to join battle.’", 1
"If we can bring some influence to bear upon Don Custodio so that he, in accordance with his liberal tendencies, may report favorably, all is won, for the General showed himself to be absolutely neutral.”", 1
"Makaraig paused, and an impatient listener asked, “How can we influence him?”", 1
"“Padre Irene pointed out to me two ways—”", 1
"“Quiroga,” some one suggested.", 1
"“Pshaw, great use Quiroga—”", 3
"“A fine present.”", 1
"“No, that won’t do, for he prides himself upon being incorruptible.”", 3
"“Ah, yes, I know!” exclaimed Pecson with a laugh.", 1
"“Pepay the dancing girl.”", 1
"“Ah, yes, Pepay the dancing girl,” echoed several.", 1
"This Pepay was a showy girl, supposed to be a great friend of Don Custodio.", 1
"To her resorted the contractors, the employees, the intriguers, when they wanted to get something from the celebrated councilor.", 1
"Juanito Pelaez, who was also a great friend of the dancing girl, offered to look after the matter, but Isagani shook his head, saying that it was sufficient that they had made use of Padre Irene and that it would be going too far to avail themselves of Pepay in such an affair.", 1
"“Show us the other way.”", 1
"“The other way is to apply to his attorney and adviser, Señor Pasta, the oracle before whom Don Custodio bows.”", 1
"“I prefer that,” said Isagani.", 1
"“Señor Pasta is a Filipino, and was a schoolmate of my uncle’s.", 1
"But how can we interest him?”", 1
"“There’s the quid,” replied Makaraig, looking earnestly at Isagani.", 1
"“Señor Pasta has a dancing girl—I mean, a seamstress.”", 3
"Isagani again shook his head.", 1
"“Don’t be such a puritan,” Juanito Pelaez said to him.", 1
"“The end justifies the means!", 1
"I know the seamstress, Matea, for she has a shop where a lot of girls work.”", 1
"“No, gentlemen,” declared Isagani, “let’s first employ decent methods.", 1

"He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed;", 1
"Come up to the fire, ladies.", 1
"Now, Mr Hale, before we move things about, you explain to Mr Henderson just what you saw when you came here yesterday morning.", 1
"Are things just as you left them yesterday?", 1
"When I had to send Frank to Morris Center for that man who went crazy--I want you to know I had my hands full yesterday.", 1
"Well, Mr Hale, tell just what happened when you came here yesterday morning.", 1
"We came along the road from my place and as I got here I said, I'm going to see if I can't get John Wright to go in with me on a party telephone.'", 1
"I spoke to Wright about it once before and he put me off, saying folks talked too much anyway, and all he asked was peace and quiet", 1
"I guess you know about how much he talked himself; but I thought maybe if I went to the house and talked about it before his wife,", 1
"though I said to Harry that I didn't know as what his wife wanted made much difference to John--", 3
"Let's talk about that later, Mr Hale.", 1
"I do want to talk about that, but tell now just what happened when you got to the house.", 1
"I didn't hear or see anything; I knocked at the door, and still it was all quiet inside.", 1
"I knew they must be up, it was past eight o'clock.", 1
"So I knocked again, and I thought I heard somebody say, 'Come in.'", 1
"She was rockin' back and forth.", 1
"She had her apron in her hand and was kind of--pleating it.", 1
"Well, she looked queer.", 3
"How do you mean--queer?", 1
"Well, as if she didn't know what she was going to do next.", 1
"And kind of done up.", 3
"Why, I don't think she minded--one way or other.", 3
"She didn't pay much attention.", 1
"And she said, 'Is it?'--and went on kind of pleating at her apron.", 1
"Well, I was surprised; she didn't ask me to come up to the stove, or to set down, but just sat there, not even looking at me,", 1
"I guess you would call it a laugh.", 3
"I thought of Harry and the team outside, so I said a little sharp: 'Can't I see John?'", 1
"'No', she says, kind o' dull like.", 1
"'Yes', says she, 'he's home'.", 1
"She just nodded her head, not getting a bit excited, but rockin' back and forth.", 1
"She just pointed upstairs--like that", 1
"I got up, with the idea of going up there.", 1
"'He died of a rope round his neck', says she, and just went on pleatin' at her apron.", 1
"Well, I went out and called Harry.", 1
"I thought I might--need help.", 1
"We went upstairs and there he was lyin'--", 1
"Just go on now with the rest of the story.", 1
"Well, my first thought was to get that rope off.", 1
"So we went back down stairs.", 1
"She was still sitting that same way.", 1
"'Has anybody been notified?' I asked.", 1
"'No', says she unconcerned.", 1
"'Who did this, Mrs Wright?' said Harry.", 1
"He said it business-like--and she stopped pleatin' of her apron.", 1
"'You don't know?' says Harry.", 1
"'Yes', says she, 'but I was on the inside'.", 1
"'Somebody slipped a rope round his neck and strangled him and you didn't wake up?' says Harry.", 1
"'I didn't wake up', she said after him.", 1
"We must 'a looked as if we didn't see how that could be, for after a minute she said, 'I sleep sound'.", 3
"Harry was going to ask her more questions but I said maybe we ought to let her tell her story first to the coroner, or the sheriff,", 1
"And what did Mrs Wright do when she knew that you had gone for the coroner?", 1
"She moved from that chair to this one over here and just sat there with her hands held together and looking down.", 1
"I got a feeling that I ought to make some conversation,", 1
"so I said I had come in to see if John wanted to put in a telephone, and at that she started to laugh, and then she stopped and looked at me--scared,", 1
"Soon Harry got back, and then Dr Lloyd came, and you, Mr Peters, and so I guess that's all I know that you don't.", 1
"I guess we'll go upstairs first--and then out to the barn and around there,", 1
"You're convinced that there was nothing important here--nothing that would point to any motive.", 1
"Nothing here but kitchen things.", 3
"Here's a nice mess.", 3
"She worried about that when it turned so cold.", 1
"She said the fire'd go out and her jars would break.", 1
"Well, can you beat the women!", 3
"Held for murder and worryin' about her preserves.", 3
"I guess before we're through she may have something more serious than preserves to worry about.", 3
"Well, women are used to worrying over trifles.", 3
"And yet, for all their worries, what would we do without the ladies?", 3
"Not much of a housekeeper, would you say, ladies?", 3
"There's a great deal of work to be done on a farm.", 3
"And yet I know there are some Dickson county farmhouses which do not have such roller towels.", 3
"Those towels get dirty awful quick.", 3
"Men's hands aren't always as clean as they might be.", 3
"Ah, loyal to your sex, I see.", 3
"But you and Mrs Wright were neighbors.", 1
"I suppose you were friends, too.", 1
"I've not seen much of her of late years.", 1
"I've not been in this house--it's more than a year.", 1
"And why was that?", 1
"You didn't like her?", 1
"I liked her all well enough.", 1
"Farmers' wives have their hands full, Mr Henderson.", 3
"It never seemed a very cheerful place.", 1
"I shouldn't say she had the homemaking instinct.", 3
"Well, I don't know as Wright had, either.", 3
"You mean that they didn't get on very well?", 1
"But I don't think a place'd be any cheerfuller for John Wright's being in it.", 3
"I'd like to talk more of that a little later.", 1
"I want to get the lay of things upstairs now.", 1
"I suppose anything Mrs Peters does'll be all right.", 1
"She was to take in some clothes for her, you know, and a few little things.", 1
"We left in such a hurry yesterday.", 1
"Yes, but I would like to see what you take, Mrs Peters, and keep an eye out for anything that might be of use to us.", 1
"I'd hate to have men coming into my kitchen, snooping around and criticising.", 3
"Of course it's no more than their duty.", 3
"Wish I'd thought of that sooner.", 1
"Seems mean to talk about her for not having things slicked up when she had to come away in such a hurry.", 1
"She had bread set.", 1
"She was going to put this in there,", 1
"It's a shame about her fruit.", 1
"I wonder if it's all gone.", 1
"I think there's some here that's all right, Mrs Peters.", 1
"I declare I believe that's the only one.", 1
"She'll feel awful bad after all her hard work in the hot weather.", 1
"I remember the afternoon I put up my cherries last summer.", 1
"Well, I must get those things from the front room closet,", 1
"You coming with me, Mrs Hale?", 1
"You could help me carry them.", 1
"My, it's cold in there.", 1
"Wright was close.", 1
"I think maybe that's why she kept so much to herself.", 1
"She didn't even belong to the Ladies Aid.", 1
"I suppose she felt she couldn't do her part, and then you don't enjoy things when you feel shabby.", 1
"She used to wear pretty clothes and be lively, when she was Minnie Foster, one of the town girls singing in the choir.", 1
"But that--oh, that was thirty years ago.", 1
"This all you was to take in?", 1
"She said she wanted an apron.", 1
"Funny thing to want, for there isn't much to get you dirty in jail, goodness knows.", 3
"But I suppose just to make her feel more natural.", 1
"She said they was in the top drawer in this cupboard.", 1
"And then her little shawl that always hung behind the door.", 1
"Do you think she did it?", 1
"Oh, I don't know.", 1
"Well, I don't think she did.", 1
"Asking for an apron and her little shawl.", 3
"Worrying about her fruit.", 3
"Mr Peters says it looks bad for her.", 1
"Mr Henderson is awful sarcastic in a speech and he'll make fun of her sayin' she didn't wake up.", 1
"Well, I guess John Wright didn't wake when they was slipping that rope under his neck.", 3
"No, it's strange.", 1
"It must have been done awful crafty and still.", 1
"They say it was such a--funny way to kill a man, rigging it all up like that.", 1
"That's just what Mr Hale said.", 1
"There was a gun in the house.", 1
"He says that's what he can't understand.", 1
"Mr Henderson said coming out that what was needed for the case was a motive; something to show anger, or--sudden feeling.", 1
"Well, I don't see any signs of anger around here,", 3
"It's wiped to here,", 1
"Wonder how they are finding things upstairs.", 1
"I hope she had it a little more red-up up there.", 3
"You know, it seems kind of sneaking.", 1
"Locking her up in town and then coming out here and trying to get her own house to turn against her!", 1
"But Mrs Hale, the law is the law.", 3
"Better loosen up your things, Mrs Peters.", 1
"You won't feel them when you go out.", 1
"She was piecing a quilt.", 1
"It's log cabin pattern.", 1
"I wonder if she was goin' to quilt it or just knot it?", 1
"They wonder if she was going to quilt it or just knot it!", 3
"Frank's fire didn't do much up there, did it?", 3
"Well, let's go out to the barn and get that cleared up.", 1
"I don't know as there's anything so strange, our takin' up our time with little things while we're waiting for them to get the evidence.", 3
"I don't see as it's anything to laugh about.", 1
"Of course they've got awful important things on their minds.", 3
"Mrs Peters, look at this one.", 1
"Here, this is the one she was working on, and look at the sewing!", 1
"All the rest of it has been so nice and even.", 1
"And look at this!", 1
"It's all over the place!", 1
"Why, it looks as if she didn't know what she was about!", 3
"Oh, what are you doing, Mrs Hale?", 1
"Just pulling out a stitch or two that's not sewed very good.", 3
"Bad sewing always made me fidgety.", 3
"I don't think we ought to touch things.", 1
"What do you suppose she was so nervous about?", 1
"I don't know as she was nervous.", 1
"I sometimes sew awful queer when I'm just tired.", 3
"Well I must get these things wrapped up.", 1
"They may be through sooner than we think,", 1
"I wonder where I can find a piece of paper, and string.", 1
"In that cupboard, maybe.", 1
"Why, here's a bird-cage,", 1
"Did she have a bird, Mrs Hale?", 1
"Why, I don't know whether she did or not--I've not been here for so long.", 1
