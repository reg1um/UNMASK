Now somebody has put a bullet in the brain of the occupant of 208, a yid who was calling himself Emanuel Lasker.,1
He didn't answer the phone, he wouldn't open his door," says Tenenboym the night manager when he comes to roust Landsman.,1
Landsman lives in 505, with a view of the neon sign on the hotel across Max Nordau Street.,1
That one is called the Blackpool, a word that figures in Landsman's nightmares.,1
The night manager is a former U.S. Marine who kicked a heroin habit of his own back in the sixties, after coming home from the shambles of the Cuban war.,1
He takes a motherly interest in the user population of the Zamenhof.,3
He extends credit to them and sees that they are left alone when that is what they need.,1
Tenenboym says, "Only the cash and jewelry.",3
Landsman puts on his trousers and shoes and hitches up his suspenders.,1
Then he and Tenenboym turn to look at the doorknob, where a necktie hangs, red with a fat maroon stripe, already knotted to save time.,1
Landsman has eight hours to go until his next shift.,1
Eight rat hours, sucking at his bottle, in his glass tank lined with wood shavings.,3
He puts on his jacket, feels for the wallet and shield in the breast pocket, pats the sholem he wears in a holster under his arm, a chopped Smith & Wesson Model 39.,1
"Only I noticed that you don't really sleep.",3
He picks up the shot glass that he is currently dating, a souvenir of the World's Fair of 1977.,3
"It's just I do it in my underpants and shirt.",3
He lifts the glass and toasts the thirty years gone since the Sitka World's Fair.,1
A pinnacle of Jewish civilization in the north, people say, and who is he to argue?,3
But the truth is that Landsman has only two moods: working and dead.,3
Meyer Landsman is the most decorated shammes in the District of Sitka, the man who solved the murder of the beautiful Froma Lefkowitz by her furrier husband, and caught Podolsky the Hospital Killer.,1
Archie Mitchell gripped the gearshift of his 1941 Nash 600 sedan, but he could feel the loose spin of his tires over mud.,1
The late autumn rains had softened Dairy Creek Road into little more than a dark rivulet woven through the dense ponderosas and junipers blanketing the mountainside.,1
They should have known better than to take these logging roads this time of year.,1
In its reflection: an assortment of brown and green plaids and corduroys, jumbled knees and slipping socks.,1
The Patzke kids, Dick and Joan, plus three others—Jay Gifford, Edward Engen, and Sherman Shoemaker—made up the entirety of the field trip.,1
All of them with their hair combed tidy for Sunday.,1
Dick Patzke pulled on his teen sister's ponytail in the back seat.,1
The Lord has brought us a little trial by nature is all.,1
It's no wonder she had been the star pupil at Simpson Bible College, unlike him.,1
Somehow, despite his many failings, God saw fit to give him Elsie.,1
He hit the gas again and this time the car lurched forward, a river of putty-gray slurry slipping out beneath them as the tires regained traction.,1
He tried to feel comforted, but the bad premonition, the nervousness that had been ratcheting through his chest all morning, wouldn't go away.,1
This trip to Gearhart Mountain had been Elsie's idea.,1
She and Archie had been cooped up indoors, him fretting over her well-being all time; they needed a change of pace.,1
It was too easy to go haywire without a little fresh air, and it wasn't natural for a young, happy couple in their prime.,1
Besides which, she'd heard the Patzkes had just lost their eldest boy overseas.,1
Surely it was the duty of their pastor to step in and offer a kindness to the family in grief.,1
It didn't hurt that a pair of avid fishermen in the congregation had told him the trout were still biting at Leonard Creek.,3
The Patzkes could use some time alone to grieve, don't ya think?,1
And besides, I could use the practice if I'm to be a mama soon.,3
The light of that murdered sun still burns me.,3
I carry that light always, seared into the back of my mind.,1
I make no excuses, no apologies, no denials for what I have done.,1
The worlds have had enough of tyrants, enough of murderers and genocides.,1
Let us move to the only beginning that makes any sense: my own.,1
They begin to shape us, for better or ill, guiding us by the hand or by opposition.,1
Lord Alistair Marlowe was not the sort of man who gave attention to his vices.,1
You laugh, but there is a magic in stories that cannot be ignored.,1
And yet it was Tor Gibson who made me the man I am.,1
More than that, he made me want to be a Scholiast.,1
I can only hope the history books will not damn him for it.,3
The blunted backsword in my hand slipped a little as this request turned over in my head.,1
For half a moment, Crispin did a comic impression of Gibson's stooped, lurching step.,1
While true for them, under Isaac, my education was a rigor of unending drills.,1
My feet scraped against he wood, and I let Crispin have his way.,1
Crispin spun wildly, slashing a wide arc to clear space between us.,1
He came tumbling down, landing face first on the edge of the fencing round.,1
It was all that knowledge which stooped his shoulders, not the passing of years.,1
The stars are numberless, and in those days I felt that Gibson knew them all by name.,1
The Scholiast's ghost-trace of a smile told me I was right even before he admitted it.,3
Altitude stabilised; all systems good.,1
Mountains are clear today. No clouds.,1
This is gonna be a cruise.,1
Er, hey, hang on a minute, what's that?,2
What's going on? Can't you see that?,2
But I dunno what I'm seeing!,2
This...this can't be happening!,2
The whole of the mountain range is shimmering...looks like it's melting!,1
It's... it's not the same anymore! Its not normal!,2
Yeah, I can see patches of water! It's unbelievable!,1
And what are those shapes moving around? Big animals?,2
No, they can't be animals! They're too big to be animals!,1
But we're too high up to see what they are!,1
It's not just me - is it? You are seeing it too?,2
But what is all this? How are we seeing this?,2
We've just gotta fly past it! Gotta keep going!,1
The instruments seem okay...,1
Authorities now confirm that all two hundred and fifty-six people on board the Mexican jet are presumed dead.,1
According to an airline spokesperson their final words as translated from Spanish point to them not believing their eyes about the landscape they were flying over.,3
What they saw and what really happened, we do not as yet know.,1
I register the light before anything else.,1
No thoughts yet, no feelings, just light.,1
Light is usually a symbol of hope, yet at this very second, it’s distorted into disappointment.,1
It guides me to my first thought of the day – ‘I’m still here.’,1
Still a live human being fumbling to cope with existence.,1
I keep my eyes closed a little while longer.,1
Almost in the hope I might be mistaken.,1
Perhaps this is actually what happens next and I’ve passed in my sleep.,1
But of course, I know that’s not the case.,1
I’ve got another day of facing it.,3
I raise myself up and sit on the side of my bed for some time.,1
I don’t know why I do this.,1
All it really does is prolong things, but it feels like I need this step.,1
Eventually I get up and accept it has begun.,3
I get my things ready to leave.,1
This all takes quite a large amount of time because… well, this will become apparent soon enough.,1
Even to what would be deemed above average.,1
It is in no way connected to average.,1
I search for some instruction and cling to it when it appears.,1
I step outside in the knowledge that the worst is yet to come.,3
We’ll start by creating the HTML of each page.,1
It’s the look and feel, colors, fonts, layout, and more.,1
Before we talk about code, let’s talk about files.,1
You can think of a computer file as a single zombie.,1
A nest is kind of like a computer folder.,1
It’s a way of structuring and gathering zombies together to make them easy to find.,1
If you know which nest they are in, it’s much easier to narrow your search to that particular nest.,1
A web page itself is like a zombie nest commander who can only find the zombies/files in his nest/folder.,1
If the zombie isn’t a part of his nest, he can’t find it.,1
So too are the files of web design.,1
Our website will consist of two pages.,1
The essay will be on the main page.,1
We'll create a simple website using HTML and CSS.,1
(We'll) smash the snot out a few zombies while we’re doing it.,3
The second page will be a short bio for Dr. Boople.,1
You need to know where you can find Jamal, Fred, and Maria.,1
Each zombie is part of a zombie nest.,1
That zombie has some information, like which horde he’s in.,1
They can easily find other files in their same folder.,1
CSS... you can think of as the design or the flesh and clothes of the web page.,1 
Later, the four remaining women could fully agree on only two things.,1
One: No-one saw the bushland swallow up Alice Russell.,1
And two: Alice had a mean streak so sharp it could cut you.,1
The women were late to the rendevous point.,1
The retreat leader was waiting for the five of them, looking warm and welcoming in his official red fleece.,1
The men threw their high-tech sleeping bags into the back of the mini-van, breathing with relief as they climbed in.,1
The van was stocked with trail mix and thermos coffee.,1
The men leaned past the food, reaching instead for the bag containing their surrendered mobile phones.,1
The pale winter sun had fully emerged only once in the past four days.,1
One of them cracked a joke about women's map-reading skills and all of them laughed.,1
They drank coffee and waited for their colleagues to appear.,1
It was an hour before smugness gave way to irritation.,1
One by one the five men prised themselves from the soft seats and trudged up and down the dirt road.,1
They thrust their phones towards the sky as though the extra arm's length would capture the elusive signal.,1
It had been a long few days and hot showers and cold beers were waiting.,1
The retreat leader stared at the trees.,3
The park rangers' voices light as they pulled on high-vis vests.,3
They knew where people went wrong and there were hours of daylight left.,1
Faces were set.,3
The banter had disappeared with the light.,3
Too worried to sleep, his father, Chan Ah Chai, stood at the window watching for a sign of his son through the blinding downpour.,1
The rain had started at midnight and was still pummeling the ground at 4:00 a.m.,1
Flooding the streets and overflowing the lakes in the public gardens, where the century-old saman trees stretch their massive canopies over Residency Road.,1
A wiry, exuberant man of thirty-one, the younger Chan was not the type to stay out late without calling.,1
He had been home for dinner that evening, as usual, after working all day at the aquarium shop he opened a few years back.,1
Even as a child, he had loved anything with fins.,1
Now he was expert in one species in particular: the Asian arowana, the most expensive tropical fish in the world.,1
In Chinese, the creature is known as lóng yú, the dragon fish, for its sinuous body plated with large scales as round and shiny as coins.,1
At maturity, the primitive predator reaches the length of a samurai sword, about two to three feet, and takes on a multihued sheen.,1
A pair of whiskers juts from its lower lip, and two gauzy pectoral fins extend from its sides, suggesting a dragon in flight.,1
This resemblance has led to the belief that the fish brings prosperity and good fortune, acting as a protective talisman to ward off evil and harm.,1
The popularity of the species had exploded around the time that Chan Kok Kuan quit his job as a welder to pursue his dream of selling exotic fish.,1
Rumors swirled that a single rare specimen had fetched $150,000 from a Japanese buyer.,3
Though Chan didn’t cater to such elite collectors, he possessed an eye for selecting arowana that were healthy and strong.,1
As many as fifty occupied his store at a time, each isolated in its own tank to prevent the fish from fighting to death.,1
Most were young, between the size of Chan’s palm and his shoe, and sold for up to $1,500 apiece to local aficionados.,1
One such businessman had called earlier that afternoon, asking to buy the remainder of his stock.,1
His father helping out at the shop as he did everyday, had overheard the conversation and warned his son to accept only cash.,1
Now, as the elder Chan peered out the window through the torrential deluge, he wondered if the boy had returned to the shop after dinner to meet this buyer.,3
Around 6:00 a.m., as soon as the rain stopped, the father climbed onto his motorbike and drove downtown.,1
They drop the slips of paper inside the hat, extending and releasing like carnival cranes.,1
The hats are then collected by a particularly ghoulish bureaucratic employee, their contents dumped inside a spinning ball, the location of which is kept secret.,1
Back at home, the dead turn on their screens or plug in their phones or their AM/FM radios (depending on when they died).,1
There was some debate, at first, over whether to broadcast the lottery live.,1
In the afterlife, your day and night are the same as they were on Earth.,1
It seemed unfair that every dead Japanese person who'd ever lived would be sleeping when the results were announced.,1
But selecting a time was better than selecting no time.,1
What the dead win is the chance to walk among the living for exactly three minutes.,1
Very little can be accomplished in three minutes (aside from murder, ask around) but three is all they get.,3
This explains why every ghost sighting in history has taken about the same amount of time.,1
They don't wait in line with you at the supermarket or watch television over your shoulder.,1
On top of which, they have their pads of paper revoked for all eternity.,1
They miss it so much, the chance to participate in the mundane, it consumes them beyond reason.,1
This is the story Clive Glenn's mother used to tell him whenever he'd complain of boredom.,1
I think about this story a lot these days, which is strange, since Clive has given me plenty to think about since.,1
It's more successful as an anecdote than a lesson, but part of the story had stuck with Clive, maybe the wrong part.,3
Your parents pack you a suitcase full of pedagogical messaging and by the time you're grown, it turns out most of the items were perishable anyway.,3
I remember the day I heard Clive talk so earnestly about this parallel ghost world, expecting him to laugh it off.,1
That's the first time I can recall thinking something was off with him.,1
For all our surface similarities, there was a whole layer of one-eyed sea creatures on Clive's ocean floor.,3
Let nothing be done rashly, and at random, but all things according to the most exact and perfect rules of art.,1
At what time soever thou wilt, it is in thy power to retire into thyself, and to be at rest, and free from all businesses.,1
A man cannot any whither retire better than to his own soul.,1
By tranquillity I understand a decent orderly disposition and carriage, free from all confusion and tumultuousness.,1
Let these precepts be brief and fundamental, which as soon as thou dost call them to mind, may suffice thee to purge thy soul throughly.,1
All reasonable creatures are made one for another.,1
It is part of justice to bear with them.,1
It is time for thee to make an end.,3
What remains then, but that thou often put in practice this kind of retiring of thyself, to this little part of thyself.,1
Keep thyself from distraction, and intend not anything vehemently, but be free and consider all things, as a man.,1
Let those two be among the most obvious and at hand.,1
The things or objects themselves reach not unto the soul, but stand without still and quiet.,1
It is from the opinion only which is within, that all the tumult and all the trouble doth proceed.,1
All these things, which now thou seest, shall within a very little while be changed, and be no more.,1
This world is mere change, and this life, opinion.,3
If reason is general, then is that reason also, which prescribeth what is to be done and what not, common unto all.,1
As generation is, so also death, a secret of nature’s wisdom.,1
He that would not have such things to happen, is as he that would have the fig-tree grow without any sap or moisture.,3
Let opinion be taken away, and no man will think himself wronged.,1
If no man shall think himself wronged, then is there no more any such thing as wrong.,1
That which makes not man himself the worse, cannot make his life the worse.,1
Continue then to take notice of it, as thou hast begun, and whatsoever thou dost, do it not without this proviso, that it be a thing of that nature that a good man may do it.,1
Look into the matter itself, and see what it is in very truth.,1
Hast thou reason? I have.,1
Why then makest thou not use of it?,1
For if thy reason do her part, what more canst thou require?,1
Within ten days, if so happen, thou shalt be esteemed a god of them, who now will esteem of thee no better than of a mere brute, and of an ape.,1
Not as though thou hadst thousands of years to live.,1
Death hangs over thee: whilst yet thou livest, whilst thou mayest, be good.,1
That which is fair and goodly, whatsoever it be, and in what respect soever it be, that it is fair and goodly, it is so of itself, and terminates in itself, not admitting praise as a part or member.,1
Doth the emerald become worse in itself, or more vile if it be not commended?,3
Not to wander out of the way, but upon every motion and desire, to perform that which is just.,1
Whatsoever is expedient unto thee, O World, is expedient unto me.,3
O Nature! from thee are all things, in thee all things subsist, and to thee all tend.,1
Thou lovely city of God?,3
Trouble not thyself any more henceforth, reduce thyself unto perfect simplicity.,1
Doth any man offend? It is against himself that he doth offend: why should it trouble thee?,1
Use recreation with sobriety.,1
Whatsoever I do either by myself, or with some other, the only thing that I must intend, is, that it be good and expedient for the public.,1
Be not therefore ashamed, whensoever thou must use the help of others.,1
Let not things future trouble thee.,1
All things are linked and knitted together, and the knot is sacred.,1
Thou must comfort thyself in the expectation of thy natural dissolution, and in the meantime not grieve at the delay.,1
It is not in any man’s power to constrain thee to transgress against him.,3
Wipe off all opinion stay the force and violence of unreasonable lusts and affections.,1
Circumscribe the present time examine whatsoever it be that is happened, either to thyself or to another.,1
Rejoice thyself with true simplicity, and modesty.,1
All middle things between virtue and vice are indifferent unto thee.,1
Finally, love mankind; obey God.,1
All things (saith he) are by certain order and appointment.,1
As for praise and commendation, view their mind and understanding, what estate they are in.,1
Free from all compulsion in all cheerfulness and alacrity thou mayst run out thy time, though men should exclaim against thee never so much.,1
Let it suffice thee if all the rest of thy life, be it more or less, thou shalt live as thy nature requireth.,1
Let nothing else distract thee.,1
Thou couldst not find happiness in any of them.,1
Not in syllogisms, and logical subtilties, not in wealth, not in honour and reputation, not in pleasure.,1
How will this when it is done agree with me?,1
Shall I have no occasion to repent of it?,2
Yet a very little while and I am dead and gone; and all things are at end.,1
What then do I care for more than this, that my present action whatsoever it be, may be the proper action of one that is reasonable?,1
First; let it not trouble thee.,1
Look into it, and remembering thyself, that thou art bound nevertheless to be a good man.,1
Speak that which seemeth unto thee most just: only speak it kindly, modestly, and without hypocrisy.,1
Thou hast no time nor opportunity to read.,1
What then?,2
Hast thou not time and opportunity to exercise thyself, not to wrong thyself.,1
Forbear henceforth to complain of the trouble of a courtly life, either in public before others, or in private by thyself.,1
No carnal pleasure then is either good or profitable.,1
Thus must thou examine all things, that present themselves unto thee.,1
Never esteem of anything as profitable, which shall ever constrain thee either to break thy faith, or to lose thy modesty.,1
He shall live without either desire or fear.,1
The life of such an one, death can never surprise as imperfect.,3
The time therefore that any man doth live, is but a little.,1
The place where he liveth, is but a very little corner of the earth.,1
Much less can know one, who long before is dead and gone.,1
For there is nothing so effectual to beget true magnanimity, as to be able truly and methodically to examine and consider all things that happen in this life.,1
Be not deceived; for thou shalt never live to read thy moral commentaries, nor the acts of the famous Romans and Grecians.,1
Hasten therefore to an end, and giving over all vain hopes, help thyself in time if thou carest for thyself, as thou oughtest to do.,1
To be capable of fancies and imaginations, is common to man and beast.,1
The body, the soul, the understanding.,1
Never either speaking anything contrary to truth, or doing anything contrary to justice, is the only true property of a good man.,1
Thou must needs grant that there is a nature that doth govern the universe.,1
He does his duty as a good soldier, waiting for the sound of the trumpet which shall sound the retreat.,3
Nature’s marvellous power of recreating out of Corruption is surely not confined to bodily things.,1
Such as thy thoughts and ordinary cogitations are, such will thy mind be in time.,1
A happy lot and portion is, good inclinations of the soul, good desires, good actions.,1
It is not possible that any nature should be inferior unto art, since that all arts imitate nature.,1
Meekness is a thing unconquerable, if it be true and natural, and not affected or hypocritical.,1
To be angry is not the part of a man, but that to be meek and gentle, as it savours of more humanity, so of more manhood.,1
The nearer everything is unto unpassionateness, the nearer it is unto power.,1
It is not about ordinary petty matters, believe it, that all our strife and contention is, but whether, with the vulgar, we should be mad, or by the help of philosophy wise and sober, said he.,1
Remember the fable of the country mouse and the city mouse, and the great fright and terror that this was put into.,1
Taran wanted to make a sword; but Coll, charged with the practical side of his education, decided on horseshoes.,1
Taran’s arms ached, soot blackened his face.,1
At last he dropped the hammer and turned to Coll, who was watching him critically.,1
Coll was stout and round and his great bald head glowed bright pink.,1
Lucky for the horses,” was all he said, glancing at Taran’s handiwork.,3
I could do better at making a sword,” Taran protested.,1
That is not the way to go after it!”,1
Heedless of Coll, unable even to hear him above the din, Taran pounded harder than ever.,1
With the tongs, he picked up the bent iron and examined it.,1
Not quite the blade for a hero,” Coll remarked.,3
It looks like a sick snake,” he added ruefully.,1
As I tried telling you,” said Coll, “you had it all wrong.",1
When you strike, the strength must flow from your shoulder and your wrist be loose.,1
You can hear it when you do it right.,1
There is a kind of music in it.,3
Besides,” he added, “this is not the metal for weapons.”,1
Coll returned the crooked, half-formed blade to the furnace, where it lost its shape entirely.,1
I wish I might have my own sword,” Taran sighed, “and you would teach me sword-fighting.”,1
Why should you want to know that?,3
We have no battles at Caer Dallben.”,1
We have no horses, either,” objected Taran, “but we’re making horseshoes.”,1
A trace of a smile appeared on his face, as though he were savouring something pleasant.,3
True,” he said quietly, “I have held a sword once or twice in my day.”,3
See,” he called, “I know most of it already.”,1
Look you,” he said quickly, “at least you should know there is a right way and a wrong way to go about it.”,1
Here now,” he ordered, with a sooty wink, “stand like a man.”,1
Now it was Taran who strove desperately to ward of Coll’s blows.,1
In the doorway of the forge stood the tall, bent figure of Dallben.,1
